We are already using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate decisions—many with major moral implications. In other domains of human activity, automating a task diminishes our skill at that task. Will “moral automation” diminish our moral skill? If so, how can we mitigate that risk, and adapt AI to enable moral “upskilling”?Directed by Seth Lazar, this Diverse Intelligences project—a partnership with the Humanising Machine Intelligence (HMI) grand challenge at the Australian National University—will use philosophy, social psychology, and computer science to answer these questions.The first stage of treatment is diagnosis. The project team will begin by identifying existing and prospective varieties of moral automation before exploring the philosophical and social-psychological foundations of the argument from moral automation to moral deskilling. In doing so, the team will determine just why, and how much, we should be worried about moral deskilling.The next stage of treatment is mitigation and adaptation. The team will propose technological and institutional solutions to mitigate the risk of moral deskilling, but they will also argue that AI systems will enable us to adapt to the challenge of automation by morally upskilling in other areas. In particular, some measure of moral automation will free us up to pursue the morally most demanding aspects of our personal relationships. AI research will enable new kinds of moral knowledge and moral inquiry; and by affording us new understandings and capacities, it can make new kinds of moral behavior possible. Dr. Lazar’s project will produce scholarship of the highest order. But the team’s goals are not narrowly academic. Through the HMI project, they will translate their research to maximize its impact at all levels of society.",0469,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/moral-skill-and-artificial-intelligence

Although Gould’s thought experiment intended to make the case for the contingency of complex bodies, it is particularly provocative for the implications that it might have for the replicability of complex minds. Studies of convergent evolution, or the independent origination of similar biological forms in the living world, have challenged Gould’s thesis.Much attention has been devoted to the importance of convergence as a general evolutionary phenomenon, but scholars have yet to systematically explore its philosophical implications for the deep structure of mind, meaning, and moral value. Directed by Russell Powell, this Diverse Intelligences project will bring together an international team of experts in the philosophy of evolution and cognition. They will examine what patterns of convergence in the evolution of social norms. Whereas many theorists assume that higher cognition or even language is necessary for the appearance of social norms, Prof. Powell’s team will develop a more inclusive account that encompasses far greater swaths of animal life. In short, the project will provide conceptual and empirical foundations for the bold claim that normativity and the moral value and valuing to which it gives rise are not accidental outcomes of human evolution but law-like fixtures of biospheres.

In doing so, they hope to move toward a better appreciation of the true diversity of intelligence.Cephalopods live in a strange underwater world, solving puzzles and using tools with a nervous system far less centralized than our own top-heavy, large-brain architecture. And they do this mostly alone and over short lives spanning a few years. Cephalopod capabilities for problem solving are stunning. How can we explain this, and what does it tell us about ourselves? The answers lie in the data. There exist many studies and observations—particularly on octopus, squid, and cuttlefish—but these data are spread across the literature.In this Diverse Intelligences project, the team will compile all available literature on the brains, bodies, behavior, life history, sociality, reproductive patterns, and ecology of cephalopods into a database. Such a database can highlight gaps in our knowledge, and it can help us see patterns we may not notice in studying a single species. Data without theory can mislead us. But when we compare these patterns to the patterns found in other comparable databases—primates and, more recently, whales and dolphins—we can begin to appreciate the diversity of both intelligence and the evolutionary paths to intelligence. We can see the intelligence of our own species from a rare external perspective.The cultural brain hypothesis is an ambitious general theory of brain evolution. If the cultural brain hypothesis can explain the intelligence of cephalopods, Dr. Muthukrishna and his team will, for the first time, have a general theory of the evolution of brains and intelligence across the animal kingdom. Using theory, data, and advanced statistics, such as phylogenetically controlled causal path modeling, the team will meet these other minds to learn about them and ask them about ourselves.",0464,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/theory-cephalopod-intelligence-alien-intelligence-our-midst

But researchers in these disciplines rarely work together—or even understand each other.With a goal of advancing both fields, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (Duke University) aims to foster mutual appreciation and collaboration. To do so, his project will hold three annual summer seminars. Over the course of 14 days, ten fellows from neuroscience will study contemporary philosophy; ten fellows from philosophy will learn about recent developments in neuroscience. These seminars will include theories and methods in both disciplines.While studying the field outside their expertise, fellows will form interdisciplinary teams that will design their own experiments on big questions. The project will fund the most promising of these experiments, carried out with guidance from project staff and reported at the next year’s seminar. Each seminar will close with a two-day public conference with leading figures from both disciplines.The project’s outputs will include three seminars that train 60 fellows and feature around 60 speakers, as well as three conferences that educate over 300 audience members. Later outcomes will include at least 20 original research papers by the fellows and directors.The team seeks to create lasting bonds among future leaders in philosophy and neuroscience. Through these bonds, they can continue to collaborate for many years on more interdisciplinary research projects that address big questions. This project has the potential to change both fields by stimulating new interdisciplinary courses and programs in many universities.

Politicians seem to think so, often using divisive rhetoric and fearmongering to unite their political party against a common enemy. Recent research supports the premise that between-group conflict may be a “necessary evil” to promote and maintain the high levels of cooperation characteristic of human groups. Furthermore, parochial altruism—heightened ingroup favoritism in the face of conflict—may have biological underpinnings deeply rooted in our evolution.Specifically, oxytocin and testosterone, hormones linked to prosociality and competition, respectively, moderate the positive feelings we experience toward our groupmates and the hostility we feel toward others. Of course, all social animals have rich social lives and elaborate social capacities. They should, like humans, also benefit from a high degree of group cohesion and cooperation when encountering a common threat.How common is conflict as a driver of cooperation? And do other social animals experience ingroup favoritism and outgroup hostility? This Diverse Intelligences project, directed by Sarah Brosnan, aims to answer these questions to examine how competition influences cooperation, and the mechanisms that mediate cooperation during conflict in capuchin monkeys.Brosnan’s team presents two novel advances over previous work. First, past studies have been constrained to laboratory settings, where between-group competition is nonexistent. In contrast, Brosnan’s team proposes a controlled cooperative paradigm in the wild, where competition is a near-constant stressor, allowing for, rather than controlling against, a rich array of social interactions. Second, while researchers cannot directly ask how animals feel, their ability to monitor hormone levels and endogenously manipulate oxytocin—again in the wild—allows the team to answer these questions in new ways. This provides valuable evidence on how capuchins experience the world and how it relates to human experience.",0471,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/two-sides-same-coin-can-cooperation-exist-without-conflict

And how might we begin to not only assess the structure and patterns of signals, but interpret the meaning of nonhuman communication signals?Denise Herzing's Diverse Intelligences project seeks to answer these questions. Understanding language is a major obstacle in recognizing the diversity of intelligence across species on Earth. Although we have an extensive understanding of human language across cultures, we have not fully explored nonhuman communication signals to determine if language, or aspects of language, exist. Rich communication streams are central to intelligence in many life forms. Researchers have attempted to assess the language potential in nonhuman species communication signals using information theory and other methods. However, the potential details, including structure and meaning, have lacked adequate tools and testing. To fully explore nonhuman communication, we need to not only supplement complementary existing tools (e.g., information theory) but also develop new tools that reveal details of potential order, grammar, and metadata that help us interpret these signals and look for any universal structures that might emerge. Many scientific studies in past decades have attempted to discover how other species communicate. Although there have been studies of the cognitive abilities and intelligence measures in dolphins and other species, many researchers may exhibit an a priori belief that language is unique to humans, thus biasing their approaches. Dr. Herzing’s team aims to find true linguistic richness in the vocalizations of dolphins, which would represent nothing less than a paradigm shift in the way we understand diverse intelligence. Answering the question of whether nonhuman language exists will give us a deeper understanding of the world and the intelligence that surrounds us.",0468,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/why-listening-dolphins-matters-looking-language-and-universal-patterns

"$233,738",Big Questions,Diverse Intelligences,17 February 2020 - 28 February 2022,Oceania,"To investigate the diversity of intelligence, we need an account of intelligent action that isn’t biased toward the human scale. Small-scale creatures, such as bacteria, and slow-acting ones, such as plants and slime molds, need to be understood on their own terms, rather than being judged by human standards. This Diverse Intelligences project will develop such an account by focusing on the central concept of agency. Agency distinguishes intelligent action from merely mechanical responsiveness and from unguided spontaneity. But most standard accounts of agency also show a bias toward the human scale. Thus, agency needs to be re-conceived in a way that is compatible with activity on multiple scales.Through philosophical analysis and through engagement with scientists working on “minimal” forms of intelligence in systems such as bacteria, plants, and slime molds, the project team will develop a rigorous account of agency that can apply across a diverse range of spatial and temporal scales. This will involve integrating agency with other scale-dependent concepts and building a better understanding of how we must conceive of agency at different levels of explanation.The project will involve a two-year collaboration between Patrick McGivern and a postdoctoral fellow, resulting in a series of papers and a monograph tentatively titled “The Abundance of Agency: Understanding Agents on Multiple Scales.”",0463,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/intelligent-agency-multiple-scales

Conventional wisdom suggests they are. But despite many empirical investigations into this claim, it has proved difficult to substantiate. In collaboration with a world-class team of developmental and computational cognitive scientists, primary investigators Tomer Ullman and Alison Gopnik will explore how play can help people and machines learn. They will use a novel computational model of play to understand two central questions: Why do humans play? And how do they develop new goals and set new objectives?Typically, computational systems have a well-defined set of goals or problems that the system must solve. Humans, however, have the ability to pose brand new problems and goals and develop new ways to solve them. Play—which, by definition, is designed without a specific purpose—may provide an important underpinning of this ability. This project proposes that much of children’s imaginative and exploratory play arises from “competence-directed curiosity”—a fundamental motivation to figure out how they can achieve goals.

Yet both the quantity and quality of the available guidance fall short. That’s where the Summer Institute in Technology Ethics at Santa Clara University (SITE) steps in. SITE is a two-week, intensive, interdisciplinary educational program for philosophers and technologists. It draws on the unique talents of its faculty to bridge significant gaps in the moral expertise available to meet these calls: a knowledge gap and a character gap.The knowledge gap refers to the missing rigor of many explorations of AI ethics currently in fashion. These methods often overlook the existing body of specialized research on the unique moral challenges of our technological landscape, and AI in particular. The SITE faculty roster includes many of the world’s leading researchers in this field. The character gap refers to the narrowly cost-benefit and technology-focused character of today’s dialogue on AI ethics. Its primary emphasis is on improving the technology to mitigate its harms and expand its benefits. This conversation neglects the task of making technology a means to further empower and enrich human capacities including those for moral intelligence and shared flourishing. As leading experts in virtue and character-based approaches to technology and AI ethics, the SITE core faculty members fill in this gap.Shannon Vallor in particular is internationally renowned for her work on using AI to sustain and enhance human moral intelligence and character. The SITE curriculum draws its core inspiration from that orientation.

"$233,927",Big Questions,Diverse Intelligences,7 February 2020 - 6 April 2022,Europe,"Empathy—the capacity to share and understand the feelings of others, and to respond to them with care—is often considered the foundation of healthy social bonds. Some have argued that our ability to empathize with others is the single most important element of moral character: the cornerstone of virtue and the foundation of morality. But recent research suggests that empathy may have hidden negative consequences. This is because empathy is not impartial, but biased by factors such as social similarity and closeness. As such, empathy can hinder moral ideals like equality and justice.How do we foster intelligent empathy while avoiding its negative potential? The answer to this question may lie in recognizing that empathy is a skill that is socially learned, as exemplified by cultural variation in empathy’s affective, cognitive, and motivational signatures. But when in children’s development does variation in empathic expression arise? What are the features of a particular society that promote the expression of empathy? To date, our understanding of empathy is heavily confined to research on Western societies, demanding cross-cultural approaches.The aim of this Diverse Intelligences project, directed by Alecia Carter, is to understand when cultural differences in the expression of empathy emerge over the course of individual development, applying novel predictive frameworks from behavioral ecology to illuminate social conditions and constraints on empathy’s expression in different human societies. Dr. Carter’s team aims to (1) systematically study cultural divergences in the development of empathy in 10 diverse cultures in Indonesia and (2) initiate a collaborative, global database documenting cultures of empathy from around the world.

This Diverse Intelligences project, directed by Rajesh Rao, proposes a novel way to achieve this goal using a paradigm that involves “raising” AI agents in different human cultures. This approach ensures deep human feedback throughout the AI’s learning process, emulating the process of raising a moral and ethical human child.Just as a child raised in a particular culture learns the cultural values and norms of that society, Dr. Rao’s team hypothesizes that AI agents that go through a period of childlike learning in a human society will acquire a “value system” aligned with that society’s moral, ethical, and cultural norms. Rather than arguing that the machine is a moral agent, the project team believes that today’s AI, when steeped in human culture, is capable of learning cultural rules, norms, and values. To test their idea, Dr. Rao and his team propose a new experimental paradigm in which AI systems are “raised” in online virtual worlds by large numbers of humans from different cultures across the world. They will implement AI systems based on probabilistic reasoning and model-based reinforcement learning using an online virtual platform and allow the AI to learn behaviors and cultural mores by observing and interacting with humans in online virtual worlds.

By giving primary and secondary RE teachers access to creative and engaging strategies, resources, and training, Stephen Pett and RE Today’s advisors will stimulate thinking and teaching about how knowledge works in religious education.This Big Questions in Classrooms project addresses the following questions:Project outputs will include twelve books of resources and strategies (six for primary teachers and six for secondary teachers). These will each explore appropriate content from the perspective of two disciplines, introducing teachers and their pupils to the questions asked, the methods used, and the answers given by these disciplines. Training opportunities will be offered alongside these print resources at different levels of engagement.The team aims to enable around 4000 teachers to practice multidisciplinary RE by giving them access to creative, stimulating, and engaging strategies and resources, along with different levels of training and support.

"$4,782,307",Big Questions,Accelerating Research on Consciousness,1 September 2019 - 1 December 2022,Europe,"Our lives dwell in our conscious experiences: this is where love, hate, regret, deliberation, and thinking reside. Every day, we lose and regain consciousness as we fall asleep and wake up. Yet consciousness is one of the least understood aspects of human nature—perhaps even nature at large.What mechanisms give rise to consciousness? Extensive research has explored this question, leading to several prominent theories. But so far, the focus has been on testing each theory independently. A crucial question remains: which theory has higher explanatory power when tested against each other directly? Led by Lucia Melloni, this project aims to bridge that gap. In the context of an adversarial collaboration, it will test two prominent theories of consciousness: the Global Neuronal Workspace theory (GNW), first developed by Bernard Baars and later championed by Stanislas Dehaene, and the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposed by Giulio Tononi. It will conduct two studies to test incompatible predictions of the theories, with the aim to accelerate progress in the field by producing legitimate evidence in support of one theory over the other. The team follows core principles of open science: adversarial collaboration, powered studies, replication, and outsourcing of testing to impartial, highly qualified labs. This approach will ensure the highest standard of scientific practices, reducing potential biases in data analysis and assuring robustness of the findings.If successful, this project will accelerate research on consciousness by providing decisive, field-transformative evidence in favor of one theory and against the other. It will also establish a groundbreaking model for scientific practices in cognitive neuroscience at large, by demonstrating the impact of team-based adversary research and open data. This will address major riddles in the field, much like established practices in other fields such as physics and genomics have done. Thus, this project may dramatically change the landscape of research—that is, the social practices and norms—in the field of cognitive neuroscience.",0389,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/accelerating-research-consciousness-adversarial-collaboration-test-contradictory

But this project, led by Joseph LeDoux of New York University, is pursuing a different idea. His project centers on survival circuits, that is, circuits of brain cells that help organisms respond to threats in quick and (presumably) non-conscious ways. The project will explore how the complex interactions of these subcortical circuits influence cognition and consciousness, thus shaping human nature.This project aims to direct future research on survival circuits and their interactions. LeDoux is joined by a world-class, multidisciplinary team of researchers and consultants. Using state-of-the-art techniques in animal studies, they will record and manipulate neural activity to identify specific neurobiological mechanisms, particularly in relation to interactions between survival circuits. They will also record and manipulate neural activity in humans. Although current methods of studying humans have less anatomical precision than those studying animals, it is possible to explore correlates of—and the effects of neural manipulations on—conscious experiences.The team plans to publish high-impact publications that illustrate the value of studying such mechanisms beyond the scope of mental disorders including the nature of well-being.

Much depends upon the ability to detect intelligence, even at drastically unexpected time and length scales. Discussions of which animals have intelligence—and the near-ubiquitous focus on the entire animal as a single, privileged level of focus for intelligence—only address the tip of the iceberg.Rather than posit intelligence as a characteristic of whole organisms, Michael Levin hypothesizes that it is present at multiple levels and scales within every living creature. From the subcellular to organs, and from individuals to swarms and collectives, his team will explore these nested intelligences. This groundbreaking study seeks to broaden our sense of intelligences everywhere.Recent efforts in the science of primitive cognition, the philosophical direction of panpsychism, and mathematics (e.g., Integrated Information Theory) have expanded our definitions of intelligence in much-needed directions. But one limitation is that it remains unclear how to move beyond philosophy to empirical tests of these ideas.This project will establish a proof-of-principle for using expanded definitions of intelligence to reach new capabilities at the bench. The team will go in two directions, above and below the individual:
(1) train an ant colony (not individual ants) via instrumental behavior shaping, demonstrating communication with a group mind as empirical evidence that a group intelligence exists in this system;
(2) produce trainable biological systems comprised of embryonic cells and tissues, showing that the components of the body are intelligent.Outputs will include scientific papers and presentations at conferences. The team will also create an intelligence detector kit: a simple set of protocols for disseminating these ideas into the public (from high-school to post-doc levels).",0315,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/establishing-communication-and-control-aimed-multiple-nested-intelligences-within

The novel understanding of the human that emerges from recent advances in engineering and bio-sciences trouble the comprehension of the human that is silently transported by our terms, words, and concepts. Fields like AI research, microbiome studies, or gene editing, for example, undermine the distinction between the human and nature or between humans and machines.Directed by Tobias Rees, the Berggruen Institute’s Transformations of the Human program emerges from a recognition of these issues. More specifically, it seeks to make the human questions at stake in AI part of AI design itself. One avenue of investigation is a research fellowship that gives junior researchers, philosophers, and social scientists an opportunity to work in AI laboratories on a daily basis. Their task is to discover philosophical questions—instances of the transformation of the human—that silently reverberate in the concrete everyday labor of the engineering researchers. This partnership with the Berggruen Institute places junior scholars in key AI labs (e.g., MIT) to observe and investigate AI programmers.Jacob Browning’s research is particularly aligned with the project’s goal, addressing the following question: What would it mean to program a computer that cares? His research will engage engineers at MIT and NYU in the programming phase by observing them in the laboratory and capturing how issues of caring—in this case, self-expression—are discussed and formulated, even if ultimately rejected as technologically unfeasible.

This project posits that RE has a distinctive contribution to make to the development of epistemic literacy in students.Epistemic literacy refers to capabilities that allow people to appreciate the distinct frameworks and systems of knowledge, methods, language, and data that pertain to particular disciplines. If students and teachers are to avoid misconceptions about how knowledge works and develop insights into specific knowledge forms present in RE, they must be able to develop epistemic literacy. Opportunities to do so help them navigate challenging and epistemologically complex questions that exist in the intersections of subject disciplines.Little research exists to support the epistemic literacy of RE teachers as they tackle the questions of meaning that lie between scientific and religious knowledge. Indeed, these questions are often dealt with in a superficial way. Based on their previous research, Joanne Pearce and Alexis Stones hold that RE is the ideal subject to promote epistemic literacy as a valid educational aim. Subject knowledge in religious education includes a breadth of perspectives: scientific, sociological, historical, psychological, cultural, philosophical, and theological. Because of its interdisciplinary, RE can help rectify this.The project will conduct mixed-methods research to access approximately 230 teachers and 300 students to learn from existing expertise and perceptions of epistemological understanding in the RE curriculum and classroom.

This lower limit is known as Landauer’s Limit. Based on this principle, a complex computation—comprised of simpler modular components—would require an amount of work equal to the sum of each component’s required work.Surprisingly, Alec Boyd from the Nanyang Technological University found that the modularity of these calculations yields excess work costs beyond those predicted by Landauer’s Principle. He refers to this as “modularity dissipation.” Thus, in addition to Landauer’s relationship between information and energy, complexity itself has real, well-defined energetic consequences.The current project will build on Boyd’s prior modularity dissipation results to understand how to mitigate these additional energy costs and design energetically efficient complex computations, illuminating thermodynamic structural principles of complex information processing.To understand fundamental inefficiencies in conventional computing, the project team will examine digital logic—composed of networks of modular elements—as well as modular thermodynamic computers.

Today, we can probe individual atoms and miniscule energy differences with remarkable precision. Such technologies have paved the way for similar advances in the field of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics.Large-scale systems such as steam engines use information to measure and control the flow of a fuel that produces energy to do work. But in non-equilibrium systems—particularly those at nano-scale—information doesn't control the fuel. Instead, it is a form of fuel itself. Taken to its logical conclusion, information could be converted into mechanical work as Maxwell and Szilard hypothesized in the 18th and 19th centuries.To promote rapid advancement in the field of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics, the Fundamental Questions Institute has established a grant program to fund experiments concerning the use of information as fuel in quantum and biological systems. These experiments will address information exchange on a level commensurate with energy, mass, charge, or other quantifiable factors described by the laws of thermodynamics.

Viewing science and religion as cultural resources, this project seeks to promote scholarship that will help global communities address these kinds of issues with sensitivity, thoughtfulness, and empathy.In both the past and presence, people have often framed “science” and “religion” as a pair of timeless epistemic inquiries. This project takes a different approach: focusing on the ways these knowledge systems affect—and are affected by—social trust and cultural legitimacy.In the modern world, both scientific knowledge and religious institutions crop up in debates over contentious topics like reproductive technologies, immigration policy, environmental protection, and healthcare. Science and religion scholars rarely address these kinds of issues. Instead, they take such approaches as making normative claims about the proper relationship between science and religion, or exploring their bearing on subjects such as cosmology.But understanding the history and contemporary ethics of these debates requires far more than normative claims, or even a recognition of the historically contingent nature of these categories Rather, it necessitates an understanding of science and religion that recognizes that their relationship is bound up in public and political authority. This project aims to reshape the study of science and religion through engagement with critical theories. Such an approach can help the field become more attentive to the pressing political questions that face contemporary communities.Outputs

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy—the percentage of potential energy that is unavailable for conversion into work—of any such isolated system always increases. These laws hold true and are fundamental to the study of all macroscopic phenomena, from phase transitions to efficiency of heat engines.However, at the microscopic scale, the situation is slightly different. Rather than bodies of water, engines, and other large scale objects, the microscopic world is a swirling environment of atomic and subatomic particles. In this realm, the standard laws of thermodynamics are modified to take into account the unique behaviors of these micro-scale particles. In particular, the second law does not hold up in its macro-scale formulation. Calculations of entropy that do not take into account the information and control of particle dynamics are not accurate; the extracted information used to control the system has to be accounted for together with the entropy itself.Patrice Audibert Camati of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRF) will investigate the complex and multifaceted role that information itself plays in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum systems.

To create a more complete picture of how diverse cultures view the potential risks and benefits of AI, the Global AI Narratives (GAIN) project will collect and disseminate AI narratives from traditionally underrepresented regions.GAIN builds upon the work of the AI Narratives Project, a 2017 joint initiative of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence and the Royal Society. In previous work, the investigators found that the dominant Western Anglophone narratives tend to focus on anthropomorphised robots, ignoring the reality of the technology; limit representation to narrow demographic groups; and present excessive polarizing, distorting public policy debate.

Recently, reasoning has been redefined as a social skill, rather than an individual one, enabling people to justify and communicate their beliefs to reach joint decisions (Mercier & Sperber, 2011; Tomasello, 2014). Thus, human reasoning can best be observed through argumentation in the context of joint decision making. Here, the goal of the participants is to reach a decision that provides the greatest benefit to all while practicing the norms of reasoning (e.g., direct observation is more reliable than hearsay).An important window into human intelligence is the reasoning of children, who are not just “little adults” but have their own sense of reason and logic (Piaget, 1929). How children engage in argumentative discourse with peers has only been documented among school-age children (ages 11-12; Kuhn, 2001). But how young children’s reasoning ability emerges and changes across development has not received much attention.Here, we propose a series of studies that provides a developmental account of human reasoning in response to three main questions:1) Do children as young as two justify their actions and recognize their partner’s reasons in deciding a course of action?2) Do preschoolers engage in argumentative discourse with peers and practice the norms of reasoning to make correct joint decisions?3) Are there cross-linguistic differences in children’s understanding of the norms of reasoning (in some languages, for instance, speakers indicate whether they have actually witnessed a past event)?Overall, these studies will provide a window into a special form of human intelligence—children’s sense of reason and logic—and an account of ontogeny of human reasoning.

The Association for Science Education (ASE) will produce a short cinematic-quality film about Anning and the big ideas of science, accompanying cross-disciplinary primary education materials, and teacher resources. By designing an immersive learning experience for primary school students, these materials will help them recreate the journey that scientists like her undertake as they make sense of the world. The bold cross-disciplinary approach of these resources will encourage a type of critical thinking and awareness among children that is seldom—if ever—addressed and developed in the current restrictively delineated approach to learning. We aim to inspire and assist children to start to ask and investigate the deepest and most urgent scientific, moral, social and political questions.Methodology and Outputs

It requires students to formulate and refine claims on the basis of scientific evidence.The study of religion involves rational discourse on the relationships between ideas and their justification. But while there is a solid body of research on argumentation in science education, there is currently no research on the practice in religious education. Argumentation is thus ripe for new research in the context of religious education.Methodology and Outputs
Over 36 months, this project will create a cross-curricular professional development program to nurture teachers’ pedagogical skills in teaching argumentation in science and religion. By helping their pupils form and compare complex judgments from different subjects, teachers can improve interdisciplinary learning and ignite curiosity about life’s big questions.Thirty pupils ages 11–14 from 15 schools will participate as pairs: one science and one RE teacher from each school. We will invite participants to six professional development workshops mediated by university researchers who are also teacher educators. Between each workshop, teachers will collaborate to make plan lessons that supplement their own subject curriculum objectives.To assess the impact of the intervention, we will gather data from participating teachers and students.

In this project, Cartmill will investigate whether this game—and similar social play—should be considered a “proto-joke.”Humor is a complex, elusive phenomenon. It involves understanding others’ mental states and recognizing violations of typical rules of interaction. Deviations from the ordinary are central to the human experience of humor.

The project will have three parts:
(1) identifying potential instances of humor in the spontaneous interactions of apes and developing rigorous coding criteria for these events;
(2) testing apes’ appreciation for these events by measuring their viewing preferences across video of different types of social interactions;

Accordingly, intelligence can be defined based upon the problem-solving ability of organisms in variable environments.But the evolution of responses to variable environments does not require the cognition and learning of animals. Since the dawn of life, bacteria have dealt with fluctuating environments and life-or-death challenges. The result is a baroque network of molecular responses from the environments bacteria experience to the physiological responses that help them persist.While scientists have mapped out the details of the many bacterial regulatory networks, the evolutionary logic underlying the resulting responses receives little attention. And yet, these responses speak to the most primitive—and alternative—forms of “intelligence” generated by natural selection.The goal of this project is to build an evolutionary framework to understand such bacterial decision making. In particular, it will focus on one of the most important discriminations that organisms face: discerning friend from foe.Kevin Foster’s team will combine differential equation models, game theory, agent-based models, and machine learning to study the evolution of bacterial decisions across a diverse range of simulated challenges. Importantly, they will constrain models based on the known molecular biology of bacteria, exploring what can be achieved with their regulatory networks.The team’s goal is to publish the work in a series of high-profile papers that explore the limits—and heights—of problem solving in some of the earliest and simplest organisms on earth.

"$233,896",Big Questions,,1 September 2018 - 31 August 2020,North America,"Scientists often assume that the best possible model of any physical system is the one that operates at the most fine-grained, detailed level. In the case of biology, this leads to a preference for chemical and cellular-level research, yielding a wealth of data about molecular states but few effective theories that explain high-level phenomena such as anatomical structure or the behavior of organisms.In developmental biology, this reductionist tendency can be found in the belief that organisms’ phenotypes are merely the deterministic results of their genes and that the underlying mechanism must be described molecularly. However, cells are often harnessed towards large-scale anatomical goals that are not defined at the level of cells or molecules (Levin, 2014; Lobo et al., 2014). The concept that these large-scale, observable outcomes have “emerged” has also been met with skepticism. Thus, a new model is required to fill the gap between molecular-level research and seemingly unsubstantiable theories concerning the development of higher-level outcomes.Recent empirical studies suggest that a framework drawing on information theory and causal modeling (Hoel 2017a; Hoel et al. 2013) may resolve these issues. For example, in their recent research into non-neuronal bioelectricity (Levin, 2017), Levin and Pezzulo demonstrated how cells and molecular structures encode and pursue such higher-level observable outcomes at a level outside traditional molecular or cellular research pathways.Building on these efforts, the project team will combine novel theoretical research into emergence with actual on-the-bench lab work.

But many questions remain: How does collective intelligence shape individual intelligence? And can it can act as a cultural process, allowing groups to improve themselves by building on accumulated knowledge? Oxford University’s Dora Biro seeks to answer these questions in this groundbreaking project.By pooling individual problem-solving capacities, groups can arrive at better decisions than solitary agents. But collective intelligence is usually studied as a one-off occurrence, which neglects its potential to act as a cumulative—and potentially cultural—process. The project’s key goal is to test the hypothesis that collective intelligence can indeed act cumulatively, making it pivotal to understanding all social groups.Biro will create collective decision-making scenarios where individuals can repeatedly learn through their interactions with others (“collective learning”). In doing so, she will establish a novel synthesis between collective intelligence and the accumulation of knowledge at group level, which might signify the origins of culture. She will conduct research in study systems of varying cognitive sophistication: ants and birds, with planned extensions to others, such as humans and non-human apes. The research will examine(1) when and how collective problem-solving shapes learning in individuals,
(2) how the process of group decision-making changes with experience, and
(3) whether intelligence that is generated and retained in a social context can foster improvement over time, leading to cumulative culture.Empirical work will be complemented by theoretical treatments seeking common drivers of cumulative cultural phenomena.Ultimately, the project promises to spark a major shift in our understanding of the link between individual and collective intelligence.

Legere means “to choose” or “to speak” and comes from the root leg, Greek for “to gather.” Hence, “intelligence” can mean “to choose between,” implying that one gathers information about alternatives, then makes a decision.Intelligence refers to a basic necessity of life; all living organisms need to make decisions. Yet, we equate intelligence with a brain. Such focus on the mammalian brain is not surprising. The mammalian brain is energetically expensive and thus must provide special abilities not found in brainless organisms.But even humans base decisions on “best guesses”—obtaining complete information is almost always impossible. In addition, more and more evidence shows that we can make decisions without involving our brain.

To what extent can non-human animals represent imaginary scenarios?Answering this question requires a bold approach like the one adopted by Francine Dolins. Using virtual reality (VR), her project explores how imagination and creativity shape primates’ construction of reality. Her team will design a virtual world where monkeys, apes, and humans face biologically relevant challenges mimicking those found in the real world. These include such vital tasks as finding food and avoiding competitors.The virtual reality (VR) multi-user touchscreen platform harnesses cutting-edge software and hardware to generate realistic, ecologically relevant scenarios, suited to capture diverse intelligences. Most studies simplify stimuli, which, paradoxically, makes tasks too complex. A key innovation here is the creation of complex, engaging, and realistic environments to discover how imagination and creativity shape primates’ construction of reality.This project directly addresses the Foundation’s aim of recognizing the contours of intelligence. To do so, it will target intelligence defined as the computation of novel information derived from prior knowledge and experience. It will also capture its diversity by focusing on various species and cognitive processes, including memory, inference, planning, reasoning, symbolism, and deception.",0314,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/primates-virtual-space-using-virtual-reality-compare-spatial-intelligence-humans

While intelligence is characterized by objective performances in solving well-defined tasks, consciousness is characterized by internal, subjective experience not directly observable from a third-person perspective. Or so the popular notion goes.Ryota Kanai challenges this dichotomy. His team’s bold research on artificial general intelligence (AGI) seeks to uncover a novel link between these two concepts and, ultimately, whether consciousness can emerge in machines.The team hypothesizes that AGI requires the ability of mental simulation based on generative models, and that physical implementation of such functions necessitates internal causal structures in the system that correspond to consciousness.They will test this idea with a two-stage constructivist approach:
1. Identifying putative functions of consciousness and implementing them into AI systems.
2. Characterizing the intrinsic information structures of such systems to infer the presence of conscious experience.As suggested by empirical observations from psychology and neuroscience, the ability to carry out model-based planning might be a key functional component of consciousness in biological systems. Building on this idea, the team will develop neural network systems that perform model-based planning using the generative models of the environment and the agent itself (i.e. the self model). In the second stage, they will analyze the causal structure within such systems. They predict that AI systems capable of model-based planning necessarily exhibit highly integrated information—considered a signature of consciousness in biological brains.In summary, the team expects to develop a theoretical framework that characterizes machine and biological intelligence from the perspective of intrinsic information. These results will offer new design principles for building AGI, opening broader discussions on machine consciousness. ​",0306,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/linking-machine-intelligence-consciousness

By studying these loquacious creatures, he aims to uncover the vast wellsprings of communications that exist throughout planet Earth—and beyond.Whales are ancestrally remote to humans and resumed life in the oceans over 60 million years ago. Marine environments allow for efficient sound travel, giving these low-frequency, vocal specialists a kind of “global aquatic internet.” Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are of special interest because of their large auditory cortex, upside-down pyramidal cells, and clusters of spindle neurons.The humpback’s mental attributes also underwrite a superlative acoustic prowess. This includes their lengthy, rhyming, and ever-evolving songs. Their vocal repertoire also includes a panoply of less-studied social sounds, including at least 40 unique social calls. A subclass of these calls show stability (across generations and ocean basins), a prerequisite for the evolution of complex communication. These signals represent a unique opportunity to characterize and interact with a magnificent non-human intelligence.Despite the humpback’s loquaciousness, its gregarious nature has made it difficult to isolate the vocal stream of individuals for syntactical analysis. To isolate the acoustic broadcasts of individuals, this study will develop a rigorous experimental framework utilizing a high-resolution hydrophone array. The behavioral context (meaning) of these calls will be characterized by visual monitoring, observing the humpback’s response to playbacks.By applying information theory to signals derived from the array, and from the parsing of long-term datasets, we can deepen our understanding of group dynamics and information transfer in baleen whales, and other taxa (both marine and terrestrial).",0311,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/humpback-whales-quantifying-and-interacting-their-global-intelligence

By building on others’ discoveries, behaviors, and technologies, we create complex reserves of knowledge and technology that we can bequeath to later generations. The near-absence of cumulative culture in all other species suggests we are extraordinarily distinctive in our cultural complexities. What explains such species-specific social and technological complexity?One source of insight is our closest living relative: the chimpanzee. There are two ways to approach such a study:
1. The first is to understand what limits chimpanzee culture. How have they come so far only to stop on what may be the brink of cumulative culture?
2. The second is to consider that a lack of cumulative culture may not be an expression of a limited intelligence. Instead, it might speak to a different form of intelligence, highly adaptive in its own way.This presents an intriguing premise. Such an intelligence may also, to some extent, be present in developing human children. The question of cultural comparison between humans and chimpanzees is not new. But rather than leading to a great breadth of explanations, current research has converged on narrow and often limited analyses. This project comprises a series of studies investigating behavioral flexibility and innovation in chimpanzees and human children. The team will explore the question of comparative intelligence from the perspective of developmental psychology, as well as neuroscientific and economics research on decision-making. They will investigate the strengths and limitations of the cognitive abilities underlying behavioral flexibility in both species, breaking radical new ground along the way.These studies will not only examine the evolutionary and developmental paths to intelligence in humans but also illuminate the remarkable ways our sister species has flourished, with a focus on their capacity for culture.",0312,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/examining-foundations-cultural-intelligence-through-behavioral-flexibility

A host of key questions remain unresolved.World-renowned primatologist Frans de Waal seeks answers by researching our two closest primate relatives: chimpanzees and bonobos.His team will conduct behavioral observations on at least N = 30 individuals per species, comprising subjects of all age-sex classes. The research will take place at Chimfunshi wildlife orphanage in Zambia and Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There, they plan to:1) test whether sex differences exist in empathic responding,
2) examine age-related changes in empathy, and
3) explore whether animals exhibit stable “empathic personalities.”Behavioral observations will center on measures of consolation, individuals’ self-regulation of distress, and helping behaviors such as food-sharing. The team predicts that females will display more empathy than males, and that the individuals with whom they empathize will grow more refined over time. These hypotheses question several core assumptions about empathy in our own species.The team further expects individuals to remain relatively stable in their empathy. This would, in effect, show that empathic personalities are not unique to humans. Finally, they predict species differences, such that bonobos will exhibit more empathy than chimpanzees—adding to recent experimental and neuroscientific data through observations of natural behaviors.Though chimpanzees and bonobos are related to humans in equal measure, they themselves show striking differences in sociality, yielding complementary insights to human nature.

• Group-level intelligence requires a process of selection and mechanisms for suppressing disruptive evolutionary processes in groups.
• Because human moral systems present these conditions, they are prerequisites for group-level intelligence in society.
• Human moral systems have been coevolving with technology for a long time. This has led to an increase in the scale of cooperative human society, from small hunter-gatherer groups to the mega-societies of today. But we still fall far short of planetary-level cooperation and intelligence.

Jonathan Cohen’s team has constructed a new tool for modelling that will make it easier to do so, and thereby advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying human intelligence and allow researchers to draw direct comparisons with artificial intelligence.The project proceeds from two assumptions:
1) understanding human intelligence will be informed by understanding how this arises in the human brain, still the benchmark device for “general intelligence;”
2) such progress requires extensive use of computational modeling.The latter is necessary for not only addressing the complexity of brain function but also expressing it in a form that enables direct comparisons with forms of artificial intelligence. Such strategies have already led to progress at the interface between neural network modeling in neuroscience and deep learning in computer science.This project addresses two challenges presented by these goals:
1) the need to integrate knowledge gained about brain subsystems—responsible for domain-specific forms of intelligence—into system-level models of their interaction that can explain domain-general forms of intelligence; and
2) the need for software suitable not only for creating such system-level models, but also documenting, disseminating, validating, comparing, and integrating such models, including ones from machine learning that use AI.The team will use PsyNeuLink, a tool recently created for this purpose. With PsyNeuLink, they will implement existing theories of well-characterized subsystems.They will also generate computer simulations that illustrate how interactions among subsystems can give rise to three constituents of intelligent behavior at the system level:

By using a common battery of tests on rats, mice, and bees, the project will produce new insights into the intelligences of both mammals and insects.In the study, animals receive two learning tasks in which stimuli are either rewarded and punished. In the first, immediately before the trial they see a cue trial that gives them the information needed to find the reward. In the second, trials occur in a predictable sequence, allowing the animals to use the sequence information to find the reward in a specific trial. Species can solve these tasks only if they learn to apply the available contextual information to a trial.Such tasks are easy for humans, but can a rat or mouse solve them? Can an insect?

The accurate recognition of these signals fosters adequate behaviors and strengthens the bond between individuals, subsequently increasing survival chances.Humans and their closest relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, are well-adapted to recognize others’ expressions, possibly through facial mimicry, a phenomenon closely linked to empathy.

It argues that intelligent states, processes, and behaviors meet two conditions: flexibility and appropriateness. Accordingly, our aim is to understand intelligence as comprising a suite of automatic, immediate, fluid, and fluent processes that neurotypical, language-using, adult Homo sapiens share with non-human animals, small children, and even artificial and social systems.In this way, intelligence is neither reflective nor transparent. Rather, it emerges from multiple processes, often automatic and opaque. This conception of intelligence has ramifications not only for who and what qualifies as intelligent but also for moral education and therapeutic intervention. We will show empirically that the flexibility of our automatic affective system may be calibrated or attuned in ways that reflect a sensitivity to the aims and objectives of an agent. Grounding our hypothesis in studies of motor skill learning, where we clearly see automatic motor routines develop as a result of deliberate, intentional practice, we expect that affective processes can likewise be shaped and structured in accordance with personal-level, conceptual, reflective states. This serves as the foundation of our account of moral skill.We will produce a book-length monograph of empirically informed philosophy of mind, focusing on moral skill. We will also publish two journal articles, one philosophical on the nature of intelligence and the other empirical on the difference between implicit and explicit interventions on the affective responses of alcohol dependent patients.

Increasingly, personal conflicts among Wikipedians threaten to undermine the platform’s knowledge-creation enterprise.To promote a more civil Wikipedia community, this project will capitalize upon the collective power of the millions of contributors across the globe who have come together to freely share knowledge. The project team will conduct trials using the CivilServant software platform to evaluate network-based and Artificial Intelligence-driven interventions designed to expand gratitude, hospitality, and forgiveness among Wikipedians.The project will engage four Wikipedia communities from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. By evaluating practical initiatives from contributors and editors to facilitate appreciation, the project team will contribute to theory on the individual and social effects of giving and receiving gratitude. Aside from these benefits to the individual, these interventions may extend the communities’ ability to attract diverse knowledge and sustain volunteer participation over time.",0282,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/software-participatory-randomized-trials-wikimedia-communities-testing-effects

The overall entropy of the chambers would thus decrease.This experiment has since been extended by physicists to incorporate many experimental systems.But what happens when the thermodynamics at play are applied to a quantum system?The project team proposes an experiment pushing the limits of conventional thermodynamics to include quantum effects.

It aims to identify the basal cognitive condition in mammals. In doing so, it seeks to understand the evolutionary processes that led to mammalian intelligence as it manifests in great apes (including humans) and a few other species.Intelligence here is defined as complex and flexible cognition. It is “complex” in that it comprises several interacting cognitive mechanisms leading to elaborate behaviors, and “flexible” in that it goes beyond innate predispositions and narrow adaptations to apply to an array of circumstances. This project will investigate several so-called fundamental cognitive mechanisms (which underlie complex cognition) in “ancestral” mammals, the monotremes, and in the somewhat more diverged marsupials. It will then compare the results with select species of the placental mammals (the latest diverged lineage), which share similar socio-ecologies with the tested monotremes and marsupials. The project will also tease apart the roles of ecology (selective pressures) and pre-existing cognitive substrates in the cognition of the different lineages. This in turn will give insights into a vital question: Is the intelligence seen in a few mammalian species a result of a continuous evolutionary process governed mainly by selective pressures? Or is it some “lucky evolutionary accidents” in the placental lineage that allowed more degrees of freedom for cognitive evolution?The methodology is based on the fact that all tested species are contemporary (i.e., they are, today, equally evolved) but differ in when their lineage arose and diverged.

Now, thanks to explosive improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) made possible by fast computers and deep learning algorithms, computers are close to achieving what many believe to be functional equivalence to humans. Indeed, according to the dominant functionalist paradigm, when computers become functionally equivalent to us, their minds will be equal to ours, too, and they will be conscious.Until now, consciousness and intelligence have been synonymous. This project aims to explore the differences between the two terms. If intelligence entails using information to inform behavior, to be conscious means that there is “something it is like” to be human—to experience a rich world of sights and sounds, feelings, and thoughts. Consciousness is fundamentally important: if we lose consciousness, as happens in dreamless sleep or during general anesthesia, then from our perspective, both ourselves and the world around us might as well not exist.What makes us human is not what we do, but what we are, and this project will put the distinction between consciousness and intelligence on a rigorous scientific footing by employing Integrated Information Theory (IIT). IIT is a quantitative theory that spells out what consciousness is, what it takes to have it, and how it can be measured—specifically, by assessing a system’s integrated information (Φ). According to IIT, certain parts of our brains are built in a way that supports high levels of Φ, which is required for being conscious.

This definition contrasts with broader views of intelligence in several spiritual traditions. The contrast is especially striking in spiritual practices aimed at achieving a state of “pure consciousness,” in which awareness is vividly present but devoid of any perceptual or thought contents. Hence, no task is being performed and no information is being processed.Cultivating states of pure consciousness allows practitioners to recognize the essential, stable nature of mind that lies beyond fleeting perceptions and thoughts—a recognition that deepens spirituality and increase well-being. Intriguingly, a prominent new theory of consciousness—integrated information theory (IIT)—makes the counterintuitive neurophysiological prediction that consciousness should still be present when all the neurons comprising the substrate of consciousness are inactive. Moreover, it posits that such a state would resemble the “pure consciousness” of spiritual traditions.In this project, I propose to use a high-density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) in long-term meditators from Buddhist and Christian backgrounds to test the prediction of IIT that phenomenal states of pure consciousness correlate with a high readiness of the cortex, signaled in the HD-EEG by low delta power, combined with a low level of neuronal firing, signaled in the HD-EEG by low gamma activity compared to other awake states. If this project is successful, it will demand a radical rethinking of the dominant functionalist, information processing view of intelligence and, in turn, validate century-old spiritual accounts.

This challenge arises at the juncture of two major societal trends: the integration of algorithms in most aspects of everyday life, and accelerating technological developments in machine learning (ML).To facilitate positive synergies between humans and AI, we must appreciate the affordances of each. Notably, creative intelligence is often positioned as the most categorically “human” faculty. Creativity is the ability to generate ideas or artifacts that are both novel and valuable. Machine creative outputs have historically been neither, but machine intelligence is likely to transform creative endeavors. A nascent example is the use of deep learning to style the short film “Come Swim.”Our project investigates the hypothesis that Creative Artificial Intelligence (CAI) can help unlock creative human potential, enabling forms of creativity unachievable by humans alone. Bringing together a truly cross-disciplinary research team (machine learning, sociology, education) allows us to:1) Generate rich qualitative evidence identifying the current capabilities of CAI and documenting human experiences of such partnerships, and2) Provide a robust quantitative framework predicting the future scope and richness of algorithmic creativity.We will do so through methodological innovation, integrating novel machine learning techniques with elicited qualitative data and analysis in combination with secondary analysis of existing structured datasets.

This technique is the most powerful way to uncover and explain the existence of diverse intelligences. The cognitive approach sees intelligence expressed in spontaneous solutions to novel problems that often require inferential reasoning or a type of mental trial-and-error. This approach also suggests that different domains of cognition exist across species and individuals.Evolution provides a powerful model against which the cognitive approach can generate testable predictions about the domain(s) in which a species will show flexibility. If cognition functions to promote survival and reproduction, then the problems a species must solve to find food and mates will predict which types of cognitive flexibility they demonstrate. The best method we have of identifying the evolutionary origin of cognition and discovering new forms of intelligence is conducting large-scale phylogenetic comparisons. Our group pioneered this approach by comparing the inhibitory abilities of over 36 species of mammals and birds; we were able to test how brain size and ecological function relate to cognition using a rigorous phylogenetic method. We also demonstrated the power of large-scale collaborations, which have the potential to accomplish far more than any individual scientist.While our initial study provides a proof of concept, it represents only a first step. We still need to develop the ability to simultaneously compare a wide range of species with cognitive tasks measuring different domains of cognition such as theory of mind, memory, communication, and empathy. To do this, we will design, build, and beta-test a website that will provide the infrastructure for all future large-scale comparative studies.

Intelligence is often boiled down to a simple test score that represents core learning skills such as pattern detection and verbal fluency. Other forms of intelligence, however, are just as essential for human behavior. One such form is social intelligence: the repertoire of skills needed to engage effectively with others in a way that is appropriate to the context. These skills are often referred to in psychology by the umbrella term “social cognition.” This encompasses abilities such as emotion recognition, effective interpersonal communication, and theory of mind. The second aspect of social intelligence is appreciation of the social context. Examples of social contexts include the cultural context (e.g., Japan vs. the UK), the relationship context (e.g., friend vs. stranger), and the environmental context (e.g., school versus home).
This project presents a bold re-conceptualization of intelligence within a framework of neurodiversity, challenging the notion that there is only one legitimate form of human intelligence. Specifically, we will explore social intelligence in autism, drawing together diverse findings to build a hypothesis that autistic social skills may be enhanced in an autism-specific cultural context: i.e., when interacting with other people on the autism spectrum. We will rigorously test this hypothesis using experimental, quantitative descriptive, and qualitative methods. In particular, we will adapt a cultural learning paradigm to explore transmission of information between autistic pairs compared with mixed and control pairs.

His project sought to understand the effectiveness of this intervention and gauge the potential to scale up the intervention to the broader Christian community and other faith traditions.The moral life has both internal and external dimensions: the virtues that shape the person, and the actions flowing from these virtues. By using spiritual direction practices, this project developed a new model for moral growth. Its design helps directees anticipate a broader range of ethical choices and make more informed virtue-based moral decisions.This new spiritual direction model is simple and easy to learn. It presupposes a backdrop of silence and requires active listening on the part of both the director and directee. They engage in a four-fold movement of reflection, affective sharing, identifying needs, and resolute action. The project’s theoretical basis is rooted in the Catholic tradition, which draws on an understanding of an intimate connection between the spiritual and the moral life. Although it draws on Catholic spiritual practices, the project took an ecumenical approach that reaches across faith traditions.“Spiritual Direction and the Moral Life” created a mix of print, video, and internet-based materials for spiritual directors.

The American chestnut provided a rot-resistant, straight-grained lumber pervasive in furniture, fencing, and construction; an annual nut crop; food and habitat for everything from bees to bears; and the leaves contained more important nutrients than other local vegetation, which were returned to the soil to foster biodiversity.Sometime in the late 19th century, imported Asian chestnut trees carried with them a fungus that decimated the American chestnut population. The blight fungus colonizes wounds in the tree trunk, producing oxalic acid, which kills tree cells. Anything above the canker dies. Over the subsequent 50 years, the fungal blight spread through the entire population of nearly three billion trees. Today, the same region’s population of adult American chestnut trees over 24 inches in diameter is estimated to be fewer than 100.

It requires planning, comprehension of the physical world, and, sometimes, the ability to copy from others. It may even have prepared the human brain for language. But it is rare. The making of other structures (e.g., bird nests) is, however, quite common, and nest building appears to share features of tool use, including choice of appropriate materials and the manipulation of those materials into a suitable structure. Importantly, recent work has shown that nest building by birds is not all instinctive; rather, nest builders have the same or similar intellectual capabilities as those required for tool use. In some species, however, building may demand more than the physical cognition of tool use, as some birds build their nests together. This raises the possibilities that birds collaborate in nest building, and that parents have the opportunity to teach their offspring to build.
This project will collect video data of sparrow weavers building to determine whether birds that build nests together do so through observing others and by working flexibly in response to their building partners. If they do, then nests may be subject to cultural evolution, and similarity of structure—once thought to be the result of instinct—may be due to conformity. If building nests requires more than the intelligence that underpins tool use (“collaborative intelligence”), then the diversity of building across the animal kingdom would provide a new opportunity to investigate the evolution of intelligence.
We will disseminate our results widely to both academic audiences and, through a range of media, to the public.

"$215,000",Big Questions,,1 August 2017 - 31 July 2019,North America,"Until recently, the wisdom of the world’s many religions existed in separate silos, blocked from other traditions by barriers of language, distance, and slow communications. Now more than at any time in history, this collective wisdom is available to anyone. With the click of a mouse, you can access an enormous wealth of information and practice. Without a guide, though, it’s easy to lose your way.Sir John Templeton’s writings draw direct connections between spiritual information and human virtue and progress—but he also identifies obstacles that might slow our advance. Taking his cue from in Sir John's book Wisdom from World Religions: Pathways Toward Heaven on Earth, Kenneth Rose created a massive open online course (MOOC) on the tenets and lessons from major faith traditions.MOOCs are courses offering unlimited participation and open access online. They often include traditional course materials such as recorded lectures, assigned readings, and problem sets. Many also enable interactive learning forums supporting community interactions among professors, students, and facilitators.By creating a free course available to anyone, Wisdom from World Religions provided an interactive platform to disseminate and popularize Sir John’s ideas to a broad audience. This six-week course included Sir John’s essays, video lectures, interactive quizzes, facilitated learning, and experiential activities built within a Learning Management System (LMS). The project team also oversaw a robust social media campaign designed to maximize international and multi-faith engagement.Methodology and Outputs
In its first year, the team conducted research and developed the MOOC following the ADDIE instructional design model. Using a representative sampling of the content of Wisdom from the World Religions, Dr. Rose then designed a syllabus and filmed a series of short video lectures that synthesized the content of the required readings.The second year involved marketing and implementation of the MOOC, along with pre- and post-testing. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the team assessed the initial group of registrants. Based on the results of the assessment, the team strengthened the course and launched it a second time. It also worked with a leading communications firm on a global promotional campaign to build awareness, gain enrollments, and encourage earned media.",0230,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/wisdom-world-religions-massive-open-online-course

The rapid growth of machine learning has the potential to change this, challenging human self-understanding and its articulation by the humanities and religious traditions.
John Cornwell seeks to strengthen the interactions between machine learning proponents and their counterparts in the humanities and religious traditions. To do this, his project will hold a series of three interdisciplinary, invitation-only conferences at Jesus College, Cambridge over a period of two years. The conference series aims to ensure that the resources of the humanities and of religious traditions will bear on future developments in artificial intelligence. It also seeks to expose those in the humanities and religious traditions to the rapidly advancing field of machine learning so that they can better understand the possible implications of artificial intelligence for human flourishing.OutputsConference 1—""Who's Afraid of the Super-Machine? AI Sci-Fi in Film and Literature""
By exploring fictional narratives in which machine learning looms large, the first conference will explore what we can learn about ourselves as human beings in relation to artificial intelligence.Conference 2—""The Singularity Summit: Imagination, Memory, Consciousness, Agency, Values""
The second conference takes some of the central concepts in artificial intelligence (such as those named in the conference title) and scrutinizes them from perspectives in the humanities and religious traditions.Conference 3—Two Fundamental Questions
Finally, the third conference will investigate two central questions: Will advances in machine intelligence enhance or diminish our moral or spiritual selves? Will these advances create better or worse societies? The purpose of this final conference is to look at the possible impact of machine learning on such notions as the soul, religious faith, religious practice, and virtues.Essay Collections
This project will also produce a series of three edited collections of essays by leading experts in the fields discussed at the conferences. These books will encourage dialogue in these diverse fields long after the conferences themselves have concluded. ",0176,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/artificial-intelligence-and-future-humanity

1.  Spirituality is a critical component of human progress.
2.  Pluralism plays a critical role in advancing spiritual development and human progress.Several understandings underlie these hypotheses:
1. Understanding spirituality primarily in terms of religion. As such, it involves disciplines of theology and religious studies, and more, including the science of brain functioning.
2. Understanding pluralism as the diversity that is a consequence of human freedom, found especially within a relatively free civil society, and reflected in the diversity of human spiritual and religious expressions. As such, pluralism is the framework in which people encounter, adopt, and adapt spiritual insights.
3. Understanding progress as related to human flourishing in an integrated sense, including public dimensions and not limited to material aspects.This planning grant will result in a full proposal detailing a means of rigorously testing these hypotheses about the relationship between spirituality, pluralism, and progress in diverse global contexts. Given the global nature of the research topic and intradisciplinary methodology, this requires a complex literature review. It demands a scholarly community of inquiry with innovative approaches—ready to break out of stale orthodoxies.

In particular, Dr. Nicole Stephens’s team will focus on the strengths that people from working-class contexts bring to a professional workplace environment.
The team hypothesizes that people from working-class contexts may be competent in different ways from those in conventional professional settings. Settings that match their interdependent skills might better serve people from working-class backgrounds. They also hypothesize that employees from working-class contexts will experience greater fit and performance in organizations that expose them to interdependence rather than independence. Specifically, these employees will benefit from the degree to which they are exposed to interdependence in: (a) the overarching culture of the organization, and (b) their roles, reward structures, and daily activities within the organization.
To test these hypotheses, the team will survey professional employees at two organizations with different levels of independence and interdependence. They will assess employees’ social class contexts and cultural models of self, their organization’s culture, and their professional experiences and performance. They will present our findings at academic conferences and publish them in academic journals.

This project was designed to demonstrate, then assess, the unique communicative experiences enabled by virtual reality (VR) technology By combining multimedia software and wearable technologies, VR expands the horizons of existing forms of communication, instruction, and entertainment. The key question for this research is whether VR can be used to illustrate and even enter into deep spiritual truths.Sociologist and theologian Bryan Froehle collected a wide range of data on research subjects collected anonymously through the online questionnaires. Topics included (a) demographics; (b) attitudinal and affiliation measures; (c) movies and VR experience; (d) and assessment of the potential and future of VR. He analyzed data using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data tools including SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) and NVivo, qualitative data analysis software. The findings confirm that VR establishes a sense of presence and insertion that allows deep entry into narratives, increasing a sense of perspective and empathy. VR has the exciting potential to create transformative emotional experiences, engaging participants in spiritual and moral growth in compelling ways. VR also offers new possibilities for communication and learning, allowing participants to enter into realities that spatial distance and other realities render impossible to experience. It augments imagination, cultivates emotions, deepens self-awareness, and promotes a sense of transcendence beyond oneself. The overall conclusion affirms the potential of VR to offer new opportunities to engage and form the human spirit. At the same time, it merits caution and prudence since VR remains tied to emerging technological developments, including socially shareable functions. Nevertheless, as more people experience the transformative storytelling power of VR, the more recognition of its potential will increase. ",0234,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/exploration-virtual-reality-tool-spiritual-progress

Integrating evolutionary game theory with cognitive psychology, it explores the co-evolution of cognitive processing, social behavior, and the environment.
Our agent-based model will investigate how social decision-making processes evolved, and how these cognitive processes feed back into the environment that shaped them. Through a series of simulations, we will examine the evolution of automatic and controlled processes, the evolutionary outcomes of choosing to cooperate and compete for resources, and the ways in which agents’ behaviors and choices influence their environment. We will also explore the consequences of individual decision-making processes in group-structured populations.

Tackling these problems head-on, The Family Group has developed interventions to promote prosocial behavior in the Bahamas. In particular, it empowers those communities most affected by violent crime.The program comprises weekly group therapy sessions that encourage participants to share their feelings, develop empathy, and practice forgiveness. Its primary strengths lie in its cost-effectiveness and wide-reaching impact. Under the supervision of therapists, trained volunteers lead group therapy sessions. Held at venues provided free of charge, sessions take place at a small fraction of the cost of conventional therapy. This allows The Family to reach people of all backgrounds.The current program exceeded initial expectations of establishing five groups. Instead, it established over 25 weekly groups, with a combined average attendance of over 350 participants per week. To date, the success of The Family has been monitored by six biannual participant surveys, which report increased forgiveness as well as decreased hostility, shame, and depression.Having proved The Family’s power to effect change, this project seeks to build sustainability and scalability. This grant expands the work of The Family with the aim of garnering a weekly average of 1,000 participants by the end of three years.

"$258,386",Big Questions,,31 March 2017 - 30 March 2020,Europe,"Constructor theory is a radical new approach to physics.The traditional reductionist conception of physics resorts to predictions given initial conditions and dynamical laws. This approach has been successful since the times of Galileo and Newton. Although very successful in countless cases, this mode of explanation falls short in capturing certain elements of physical reality. Famous examples include information, heat, and entropy. In the prevailing conception, these entities appear in what look like fundamental laws—for example, the laws of the theory of computation and thermodynamics. But reconciling or unifying such laws with other microscopic fundamental laws is notoriously problematic, as they have only coarse-grained, scale-dependent forms.Taking a sharp departure from such approaches, constructor theory (CT) expresses laws as statements about which physical transformations are possible and impossible—and why. Designed to accommodate counterfactuals in fundamental physics in an exact manner, CT supplements the prevailing conception. In the bigger picture, CT has three goals:1. To provide a unifying and deeper understanding of physical reality;
2. to develop new tools and identify new laws underpinning emergent entities (e.g., agency, free will, and knowledge-creation); and
3. to permit a broader kind of scientific inquiry that contrasts with mere reduction to dynamical laws and initial conditions.Supported by the Templeton World Charity Foundation, D. Deutsch (CT's originator) and Dr. Chiara Marletto completed a groundbreaking three-year project that elicited great interest from popular press. In this new project, Marletto will apply their constructor-information-theoretic approach to fundamental problems in three different areas:1. Thermodynamics
2. the physics of time; and
3. quantum information.The project will develop information-theoretic laws about counterfactual entities in those areas (like heat) that have been long-considered emergent and not fundamental. Doing so will show the power of information in fundamental physics. The project also seeks to establish CT as a positive framework for science at large—one in which everything that is not physically impossible can be achieved. Constructor Theory provides a basis in fundamental physics for the freedom to become “all that we can be,” opening our minds to those endless possibilities permitted by the laws of physics.",0195,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/physics-counterfactuals-applications-constructor-theory-information

Such events threaten the ordinary frames of meaning in which groups of worshippers live. This can lead to symptoms of trauma and communal narratives that prevent healing. How, then, can Christian congregations respond with integrity, courage, and compassion to tragedies, including those that seem to have a scientific explanation?

And they seek to respond with honesty and compassion, make sense of the insensible, and integrate events into their explorations of life with God. This project seeks to explore the following questions: How can we inspire trainee ministers to react to tragedy with confidence, self-awareness, and resilience? How can their initial training instill the formational qualities necessary to respond with wisdom? What range of practices and processes will enable them to resource churches? How do tragic events relate to the narratives of Christian Scripture and doctrine in preaching, prayer and worship, and in discussion groups?

We have a solid understanding of the social, moral, and emotional intelligences involved in the development of human social norms and rituals. Yet we don’t understand how these intelligences manifest themselves in wild animal populations. Currently, we lack the methodologies and datasets necessary to their presence or absence of social norms (i.e., group-specific, culturally established rules of behavior that are moralized and enforced by third-party punishment).

There is a wealth of pre-existing knowledge about them, and they are particularly likely to exhibit social norms. Intensely social animals, they engage in frequent cooperation and conflict and exhibit overt emotional displays. They also meddle in others’ interactions, socially transmit arbitrary behaviors, and develop creative rituals for testing social bonds. Such features suggest that they could benefit from creating and enforcing social norms.

Today, the biases and shortcomings of human decision-making are standard topics in such disciples as management science, public health, and economics. As awareness has increased, so have calls to develop interventions to improve decision-making.
To answer these calls, our project adopts a rigorous and empirical approach with two main objectives. First, we aim to research training interventions designed to improve choice among options with difficult tradeoffs. We target this class of decisions because of its large size and practical implications, and because it yields a cross-species phenomenon called preference reversal, which is thought to contradict axioms of rationality. Second, we aim to advance the science of bounded rationality by testing a new model of choice. Contrary to the popular view, this model shows that preference reversals arise from rational processes that are adapted to cognitive bounds and maximize utility.

New literature has made two general points: 1. The free market is desirable, not primarily for efficiency but on moral grounds. 2. A moral defense of free markets has moral implications for the way market parties should operate.In short, the free market requires the practice of moral virtues and thus contributes to human flourishing. These insights challenge an overriding assumption in economic theory and education: markets are at odds with morality and virtues. Stemming from the 18-century author Madeville, who stated that the “public benefits” of markets are based on “private vices,” this thesis lies at the heart of the homo economicus paradigm.This paradigm – that self-interest alone motivates human beings – informs economics curricula and the dominant narrative about the success of Western free-market economies. This research project sets out to critically assess these insights, to add theoretical and empirical substance to them, and to integrate them into a new counter-narrative about free markets, morality, and human flourishing. The guiding hypothesis is that free-market societies flourish because the key market actors (states, businesses and individuals) respect morality and virtue. Drawing on various disciplines (economics, theology, philosophy, and social psychology), our research targets four different audiences: the academic community, professionals working in market-related positions, high school and university students of economics, and the general educated public concerned about the development of economics in light of recent financial crises.We aim to deliver two types of outputs: 1.

"$264,976",Big Questions,,1 December 2016 - 30 November 2019,Europe,"What sorts of processes without a fixed causal order can be created experimentally? And how does the way such processes manipulate information differ from standard processes? ​A causal order describes the order in which events occur and the effects these events have on each other. Causal orders deal with information in fundamental ways: they describe how an event occurring at one point in space-time can influence another point. All information transfers must be described through such a construct. Since information is transferred by quantum states, the complete physical description of information requires a thorough understanding of causal orders in quantum mechanics. A new description of quantum mechanics has emerged: it makes no assumption about the order of events. This formalism considers events in terms of their ability to exchange information between each other. Applying this new formalism to quantum mechanics has shown that processes without a defined causal order can exist. Nevertheless, information can be transferred through these processes. Extraordinarily, these processes can carry out tasks that are otherwise impossible. This project aims to investigate these processes and thus discover practical ways to build them in a laboratory, characterize them, and develop new applications for them. The research will study processes with an indefinite causal order experimentally, providing a physical platform to test a host of hypotheses. These hypotheses include ideas relating to the characterization of the causal order of quantum processes, protocols to transfer or compute information more efficiently through such processes, and the study of any limitations that nature may place on them. To achieve this, the project will begin with a novel construction of a process—the quantum SWITCH—which lacks a definite causal order. Showing that such processes can be of practical use will bring these issues to the attention of the broader quantum information and computation community. This work will help guide theoretical research on causal orders, bring to light new relevant details, and keep the field grounded in experiment. Beyond this, it will also impact the general physics community by revealing how one can take advantage of new quantum resources.",0194,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/experimental-investigation-indefinite-causal-orders-quantum-mechanics
"$59,743",Other Charitable Purposes,,21 October 2016 - 31 August 2017,North America,"More than seventy years ago, pioneering ecologist Aldo Leopold wrote, “One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.” Today, ecological education is much more widespread. Many people are aware of and trying to heal the wounds resulting from human activity. As a result, ecological restoration—assisting the recovery of damaged or destroyed ecosystems—is now a burgeoning field of study. Today, our planet faces a host of threats with potentially dire consequences: climate change, biodiversity loss, and invasive species, to name but a few. Our time is, as a growing number of scientists are claiming, the Anthropocene Epoch. The belief systems that inform human relationships with the other-than-human world are changing, too. Previous efforts to understand these relationships have focused on “ecosystem services.” In other words, they emphasize human enjoyment of the natural world while deemphasizing the intrinsic value of nature itself. Our proposal explores what we think is a better way: exploring the values and beliefs about nature that both motivate, and are created by, the impressive accomplishments of ecological restoration. A constant refrain in restoration is that it is more than a scientific and technical pursuit. It also grows from cultural and spiritual values—and at the same time nourishes them. Restoration requires diverse labor, creates tighter bonds in communities, and fosters new relationships between people and the natural process, something that it is much more difficult to convey in more passive forms of ecological education. Restoration also offers opportunities for cultural resurgence. For example, dozens of school-aged children volunteered their time towards the recent restoration of an old sawmill site on Galiano Island. Their contributions were honored by a ceramic art panel that embedded them into the site. Individuals will remember this experience for the model it creates of community connection. We call such a process regeneration, which is woven together with restoration. Placing these practices together compels us to think of larger questions: What constitutes restoration of an ecosystem? What is the place of people in healthy ecosystems? How are acts of restoration tied to ideas of creation, and how might this connection magnify the possibility of greater care and more thoughtful stewardship? ",0186,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/ecological-restoration-and-social-regeneration

This approach is two-pronged: 1. Boosting interest through challenges 2. Providing a free, adaptive, and personalized technology tool that can lead any identified/interested individual to the highest levels Both of these initiatives have gained momentum and reach people everywhere in the world via the internet. This proposal supports this new model, which is freely released to the public on expii.com. The first prong focuses on developing and popularizing weekly sets of creative math puzzles. Its style is motivated by the Discovery Channel, and Expii’s puzzles are carefully designed to combine intense challenge with shareability among the mainstream public. The intiative this by releasing five puzzles per week that ramp up in difficulty, and by authoring very non-standard problems. This powers a funnel for drawing traffic to other projects that further develop talent, including the Spirit of Ramanujan Talent Initiative (http://expii.com/ramanujan). The second prong is Expii's long-term R&D project. Expii’s approach uses the Elo Rating System to measure talent at high resolution at every point of the spectrum. Its viability at the extreme ends is a distinctive feature of the Elo method, and is in fact the reason this method has been used to great success in ranking World Champion chess players. Expii uses a unique mathematical perspective to decompose the general problem of personalized learning into a series of tractable math/algorithm problems, and packages the entire experience into an interaction style more similar to a maps app’s automatic navigation system than to a traditional classroom. During the period of this support, Expii will develop and calibrate their new infrastructure, and populate it with a sufficiently large body of openly licensed problems and lessons to operate on.",0193,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/identifying-and-developing-mathematical-and-creative-genius
"$214,710",Big Questions,,2 October 2016 - 31 July 2019,Middle East,"How do God and time intersect? What is the relationship between God and creatures? What can we know about God’s attributes? To what extent is imagination a key component of religiosity, and what are the philosophical ramifications of imagination’s role in the religious life?This project explores these Big Questions through the lens of analytic and Jewish theology. When brought into conversation, these two fields enrich one another. The unifying characteristics of analytic philosophy are a style of writing and shared intellectual history. Its writing style encourages sentences that can be formalized and logically manipulated; precision, clarity, and logical coherence; avoidance of non-decorative metaphors; the use of well-understood primitive concepts; and clear definitions of new terms and concepts.Jewish thought has hitherto had limited engagement with analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is the mainstay of English-speaking philosophy departments. Jewish thought, meanwhile, tends to be relegated to Jewish Studies departments, where Continental (i.e., non-analytic) philosophy prevails. Furthermore, these departments, in large part, teach Jewish thought as intellectual history.Sir John Templeton wrote, “To many, religion sometimes seems like a kind of history museum which lacks the excitement and vibrancy of other aspects of life that constantly experience innovation.” In treating Jewish thought as a sort of museum exhibit, philosophy departments substantiate Sir John’s claim. Moreover, Jewish thought’s relationship to continental philosophy, which does not always prize clear and rigorous articulation, is problematic. This relationship has made it difficult for Jewish thought to engage in conversation with the empirical sciences, which do prize such rigor. This project seeks to revitalize Jewish philosophy. To this end, we will develop and sustain an analytic school of Jewish thought using the tools of analytic philosophy. In doing so, we seek to develop answers to the Big Questions from a Jewish perspective.",0181,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/analytic-jewish-philosophical-theology

What responsibilities flow from these values? And how can universities meet these responsibilities in the face of contemporary challenges? Vehement discussions abound about the failings of modern universities to address these responsibilities. Thus, this project aims to fill a necessary gap by scrutinizing and defending such responsibilities, and providing tools for university leaders and policy makers to meet them. Our hypothesis is threefold: 1. The primary values that the university should uphold are epistemic values: those involving truth, knowledge, rational belief, insight, and understanding. 2. A university’s values apply not only to research, but also to teaching and (intellectual) character formation. 3. Universities are responsibility for cultivating humanistic learning. To test these hypotheses, we will engage in empirical, philosophical, and theological research. To this end, we will produce peer-reviewed articles, books, conferences, and media appearances. On both national and international levels, we will target academics, policy makers, students, the general public, and opinion-leaders. Based on empirical research, the project will identify ways to prevent misbehavior and promote responsible behavior in academia. Finally, the policy recommendations that emerge will be discussed in international fora and presented to opinion leaders.

1) Giving members opportunities for character formation and Christian transformation;
2) Rejuvenating the church through an increased focus in prayer;
3) Commissioning members to return to their countries and workplaces to transform culture through submission to God and servant leadership. 
For a year, community members reside at Lambeth Palace to pray and support the ministry of the Archbishop, serve the poor in London, and study theology, ethics, and the Bible. Formed by Archbishop Justin Welby in 2015, the Community currently has 16 residential members residing at Lambeth Palace, and 20 non-residential members from London who participate in the evenings and weekends. Although there are no formal selection criteria other than age (20–35), members are selected for the following qualities: 
a) Effective communication;
b) Potential to become game-changers in their own countries and in secular institutions;
c) Openness to ecumenical engagement;
d) Desire to live in and learn from a quasi-monastic community. The Community is under the direct authority of its Abbot, the Archbishop; it is led by the Prior, Rev. Anders Litzell, with support from other members of Lambeth Palace. Grounded in ecumenism, the Community provides residence to members of the Catholic monastic community Chemin Neuf in addition to the young adult members. As the Community continues, the precise model of the formation program is being honed and refined. The long-term goal for the program is to not only grow the Community at Lambeth Palace but also create new communities around the world. At present, the Community is largely funded by private donations to Lambeth Partnership. Support from TWCF will contribute to the costs of running the Community, including providing honoraria to external speakers, bursaries for community members who may not otherwise be able to cover the costs associated with the program, bursaries for staff members of the Chemin Neuf community, and the provision of administrative and learning resources.",0189,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/developing-spirituality-and-character-community-st-anselm

"$899,530",Big Questions,,1 July 2016 - 30 June 2019,South America,"How might a renewed theology of integral missiology, enriched by empirical social-scientific analysis, foster human flourishing? By engaging social sciences, missiology, and theories of integral mission, this project addresses twenty-first-century threats to flourishing. As a test case, we focus on the humanitarian crisis of internal displacement in Colombia. Since 1998, violence has displaced more than six million people in Colombia, causing a crisis of suffering and poverty. With this backdrop, a renewed integral missiology will help the Protestant Church in become a vital agent of integral human flourishing. By combining theology with social sciences, we aim to give internally displaced persons (IDPs) a sense of spiritual purpose, increased self-sufficiency, freedom from poverty, and human flourishing.Our hypothesis proposes that the human flourishing of IDPs in Colombia can thrive through empirical analysis (Participatory Action Research), a ""humble approach"" to integral missiology, and the fields of education, economics, sociology, and psychology. We will conduct activities in three phases: Research, Curriculum Development, and Dissemination. During the Research phase, teams of scholars and practitioners will study the consequences of displacement and develop proposals on how local churches can help IDPs capacities flourish. The Curriculum Development phase will elaborate curricula, resources, and models to equip churches and IDPs. The Dissemination phase will implement the materials and models in pilot communities.The project is expected to generate a range of outputs, such as reports, websites, and articles in peer-reviewed journals. Using different materials, we aim to engage both academic audiences (theologians and social scientists) and non-academic audiences (local Christian leaders, Christian laypersons, and IDPs). The project will have impact in three major ways: 1. Advancing knowledge about integral missiology, the challenges caused by forced migration, and methods to recover and flourish after displacement. 2.

This initiative is inspired by the life of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a gifted mathematician and subject of the film The Man Who Knew Infinity.A poor college dropout who was self-taught in mathematics, Ramanujan reached out to G.H. Hardy, a superstar British mathematician. Hardy was so astonished by Ramanujan’s mathematical theories that he invited him to Cambridge to study and collaborate. From the start, Ramanujan fought against the odds because of his poverty, location, and lack of formalized schooling. Yet with his brilliant mind, his dreams, and the support of the mathematical community, he defied those odds. Together, Ramanujan and Hardy innovated vast tracts of mathematics. Forced to return to Indian because of fragile health, Ramanujan died tragically at the age of 32. The three enigmatic notebooks he left behind drive cutting-edge research to this day. In the words of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg: “[Ramanujan] got one math textbook and that was enough for him to recreate the whole of modern mathematics and push the field forward. … What would have happened if he had access to the whole Internet? How many other Ramanujans are out there without access to even one book?”To support today’s “Ramanujans,” this initiative provides a range of opportunities.

To use simple computational models known as cellular automata to study how new information may be “written” into complex systems such as living organisms.2.To use the well-developed theory of neural networks to study how biological systems can regenerate by storing information about self, and how new information may be “written” over the span of a single generation.3. To use the results of the theoretical programs to perform experiments that test their predictions using real regenerating organisms, such as flatworms.We expect this research to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which biological systems can acquire new information.

The project has a research-focused Big Question and an application-focused Big Question. The first Big Question addresses current secondary education practice and policy, implicitly or explicitly relevant to character education in Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Informed by the insights gained from this research, the second Big Question aims at promoting character education across Latin America.The research-focused Big Question will be addressed by reviewing education policy; consulting policy makers in the region; and conducting six case studies of secondary schools in Argentina, Mexico and Colombia (two in each country). Case study methodology is appropriate because it allows exploratory investigation of how character education may be embedded and practiced – implicitly or explicitly – in the various activities of schools in specific social, economic and cultural contexts. Data will be generated and collected using a questionnaire survey, lesson observations, focus groups and semi-structured interviews. It is anticipated that a total of approximately 10,000 questionnaires will be completed; 150 lessons will be observed; and 410 students, 210 teachers and 150 parents will be interviewed. Analysis of these combined sources of data will facilitate in-depth understanding of how character virtues are perceived and enacted in secondary schools. The application-focused aim will promote awareness and understanding of character education across Central and South America – not just those countries where the case study research will take place.

The founders of the programme seek to fill a cultural void created by the erosion of indigenous African rites of passage by modernisation.Today, identity and belonging are visibly riddled with tensions between the ethnic and the national, attributed to the disruption of traditional ethnic beliefs, rituals and practices occasioned first by colonization and then through the influence of western civilization and its perception that local ways are backward. The challenges of urbanization, the explosion of information technology and the attendant dramatic cultural and economic changes further complicate the scenario. The resultant effect of this confusion between traditional customs and western models of adolescents is youth vulnerability to high-risk behaviour, which can lead to life-threatening challenges such as HIV infection, teen pregnancy, alcoholism, and drug abuse  without the necessary tools to face adulthood.This present study assessing the African Christian Initiation Program (ACIP) is built on the knowledge that initiation played a major role in African communities. It incorporates the old knowledge with the modern context and it shows that the transmission cannot be left to one institution but that parents, teachers and young people have to work together. The programme borrows character virtues from the indigenous African way of life and from faith-based practices to provide adolescents with information and life skills that assist with building their character for the effective transition from childhood to responsible adulthood. ​",0151,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/assessment-acip-african-christian-character-virtues-programme
"$2,744,960",Genetics and Genius,,15 December 2015 - 15 December 2018,Europe,"Autism Spectrum Conditions (henceforth autism) affect the ability to socialize, communicate, and adjust to change. Autism is heritable, but its genetic architecture is poorly understood. Although it has been conceptualized as a disease or disorder, it has a striking connection to mathematical talent: gifted mathematicians have a higher than average incidence of autistic traits and have a disproportionate rate of autism. This association between autism and mathematical talent is a neglected area of research. The hyper-systemizing theory proposes that autism and mathematical talent both share an affinity for detecting patterns in information (“systemizing”). Autism and strong systemizing talent may be genetically linked because autism occurs at least twice as often in geographical regions enriched for parents working in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math).This project addresses the question: what is common and distinct about the genetics and epigenetics of autism and extreme mathematical ability? The aims are to accelerate:1. Autism genetics and epigenetics by adopting a novel approach: whole genome sequencing (WGS) and epigenetic sequencing of 20 highly enriched, maximally informative families (i.e., those who have 3 or more individuals with autism in the nuclear family).2. The study of the genetic and epigenetic basis of math by adopting another novel approach, namely WGS and epigenetic sequencing of 50 extremely talented mathematicians (international math prizewinners).We hypothesize that both autism and exceptional mathematical talent will each have unique genetic and epigenetic signatures.

"$804,086",Big Questions,,1 December 2015 - 30 November 2018,Asia,"Sir John Templeton believed that creative dialogue between science and religion was highly beneficial to all participants in the discussion, as well as to wider society. He also believed this would require much effort and humility from both sides. One prerequisite of such a pursuit is that scientists are willing and able to enter into such dialogue. Hong Kong's research universities host world-class scientists and engineers, but the culture within the academy rarely supports engagement between science and spirituality. The Faith and Science Collaborative Research Forum will take steps to raise the bar of constructive engagement between faith and the academic disciplines of science and engineering in Hong Kong. Firstly, we will equip academic scientists and engineers with the mental tools – including the theological and philosophical grounding – necessary to rigorously consider the issues at hand in an informed manner. Secondly, we will support them in applying the skills and insights gained to their academic work.To achieve these aims, the Forum will address graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and university faculty from a range of scientific and engineering disciplines, through discussions, workshops, and conferences, as well as a mentorship program. We hope these activities will precipitate a continuing culture among world-class scientists in Hong Kong which fosters careful, rigorous, humble engagement between their respective academic disciplines and religion. Research on range of scientific, technical, and social issues facing Hong Kong may then be able to reap the benefit of fresh perspectives provided by spiritual insights.",0137,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/faith-and-science-collaborative-research-forum

We also know that we threaten our own existence, for example, by nuclear war. These home-grown extreme risks have been with us for decades, but many distinguished scientists are now concerned that developments in technology (e.g., artificial intelligence or biotechnology) may soon pose more direct catastrophic threats.The new capabilities of such technologies might place the power to do catastrophic harm in dangerously few human hands. Or, in the case of AI, they might take it out of our hands altogether. The nature and level of such extreme technological risks (ETRs) are, at present, difficult to assess because they have received little serious scientific attention. The need to consider them is a new one, but it is one that we seem likely to face for the foreseeable future as technology becomes even more powerful. Hence, it is crucial to investigate these risks seriously and learn how they can best be managed in the long term.The purpose of the new Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), within which this project is based, is to lead the international scientific community in conducting research on these issues. This project begins with a preliminary model of the components needed for the study and management of ETR. We will refine the model by implementing some of it, and by learning from our successes and failures. In this way, we will clarify both the present ETRs themselves and how risks of this class should be managed in the future. Our outputs will be both theoretical (e.g., scientific papers) and practical (e.g., establishing best practices for ETR mitigation). In the process, we will greatly expand the community of scholars, technologists, and policymakers who are aware of the task of managing ETRs, as well as their understanding of the nature of this task.We hope these efforts will substantially reduce the long-term risk of our species being wiped out by its own technological success.",0128,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/managing-extreme-technological-risk

We believe parliamentarians have a unique capacity and opportunity to work within and across national boundaries for change and that they can become highly-effective agents of change.Parliamentarians in some Commonwealth countries (such as the UK, Australia and Canada) have been key initiators of strategies to reverse the disturbing worldwide increase of restrictions upon religious and non-religious belief and practice, but we believe they can be even more effective if given the appropriate training and professional resourcing. We hope that our support will substantially impact the effectiveness of parliamentarians in their work to improve the lives of those whose freedom is presently curtailed.We select the Commonwealth as our context since it is a diverse, multireligious global family of nations which, despite its Charter commitments, presents some of the worst and best practices internationally in FoRB. CIFoRB establishes a unique advocacy, support and professional development unit deploying international academic, parliamentary and policy expertise targeted to increase the number, knowledge, profile, and impact of parliamentarians and senior advisors working for FoRB across the Commonwealth. We will approach this task through research, training, mentoring, and development.

Our driving big question is whether the benefits of meditation are compromised to the extent that it is divorced from its spiritual traditions. Despite its deep roots in Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, mindfulness meditation has been researched almost exclusively within Western psychological frameworks.The primary set of purposes of this planning grant is to empirically examine: (1) the effects of mindfulness meditation on fostering empathy among young adults; (2) the extent to which the effects may differ if the mindfulness practice involves an explicit spiritual component; and (3) associated moderators and mediators of change. The second purpose is to prepare materials to be delivered and tested cross-culturally, specifically in Hong Kong.The first set of activities of this planning grant includes: (1) compiling an extended literature review on Western, Christian and Buddhist conceptualizations and practices of mindfulness meditation; (2) writing a manual on spiritual mindfulness meditation; and (3) translating the secular and spiritual mindfulness meditation manuals into Chinese. The second set of activities includes: (4) running a randomized controlled treatment trial of secular mindfulness meditation and spiritual mindfulness meditation in the United States; and (5) running a feasibility study in Hong Kong.Anticipated outcomes include research and clinical training for graduate students, extension of the empirical research on spiritual meditation, creating a manual on spiritual meditation, manuscript publications, conference presentations, and preparation of the larger study on mindfulness meditation and virtues in cross-cultural settings. The results of this planning grant may have implications for character development training in religious and educational institutions.

There currently exists a widespread misconception in these schools that a conflict exists between science and Jewish faith. We believe that this misconception can be eliminated by preparing a suitable high school teaching unit on science and faith. The pressing need for eliminating this misconception is that Orthodox Jewish high school students are often puzzled and disturbed by the perceived challenges of science to their faith. The output generated by this project will be a teaching unit composed of six modules, each of which will provide four hours of student activity over two weeks. The modules will utilize the interactive computer technology that characterizes the modern classroom. The teaching unit will cover all aspects of the relationship between science and faith, with emphasis on the creation of the universe and the subject of evolution, both the evolution of the animal kingdom as well as the evolution of man. The clarification of these issues will help students integrate a faith-based position with a full embrace of scientific thinking. This project will help students understand that faith in God and accepting the truth of the Torah does not require the abandonment of rational thinking. Students will see how modern science imparts new insights into their ancient faith and that scientific knowledge does not threaten religious belief. The teaching unit has already received the written support of five Orthodox Jewish high schools, expressing their interest in implementing it. In the longer run, the teaching unit will enable students to develop into adults who comfortably integrate religious faith and general knowledge. This integration will produce people who are less prone to dogmatic thinking and more likely to take part in the advancement of knowledge and truth-seeking in all areas.",0135,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/developing-and-implementation-teaching-unit-modern-science-and-orthodox-jewish

The first problem will be addressed through the conceptual research of an expert, interdisciplinary group of biologists, philosophers, and theologians. This will lead to an interdisciplinary book, a set of journal articles, and an ISSR conference. The second problem will be addressed by an empirical evaluation of innovative teaching, and by encouraging textbooks and programmes of work for school biology that reflect a more organismal approach.For the empirical research, we will produce a psychometric questionnaire to measure perceived compatibility between science and religion, a module for school biology teaching and an RE module on biology and religion. These will all be available for general use. The educational research will test the hypothesis that most change in perceived compatibility between biology and religion is achieved by the combination of (i) more holistic biology teaching with (ii) RE teaching on biology and religion.This educational research will lead to several journal articles. To achieve better dissemination to the general public there will be a seminar for journalists leading to a set of journalistic pieces popularizing the new, more systemic biology. We expect that our project will lead to a holistic approach being given more emphasis in school biology teaching. We also expect to make the academic world more aware of the philosophical and theological implications of the new biology, and to make the public more aware of a less reductionist approach to biology. In both cases, we hope to undermine the widespread idea that biology is incompatible with religious belief. In the long term we expect that this will lead to a wider dissemination of holistic biology, at least in the UK, and especially in schools.

We hope to achieve this aim through practical opportunities for character virtue development and a cluster of research investigations. The project will offer a focused programme of practical action. Good character has always been closely associated with balance, the harmonious interplay of a range of complementary virtues; so we will offer postgraduates the chance to develop a balanced and harmonious character. As they progress through the programme, they will develop their understanding of which virtues constitute good character, which virtues are most important for those destined for leadership, and which virtues they most need to develop for themselves. At every stage, they will be offered tools, support, and opportunity to develop these virtues.We will focus our activity and research on four key virtues: sense of vocation, the virtue of believing I have an orienting purpose that transcends mere personal success or flourishing; attitude of service, the virtue of being appropriately other-focused, rather than merely self-focused, in my goals and actions; thanksgiving, the virtue of recognizing that I am not solely responsible for all that I have received and all the good that I have enjoyed; humility, the virtue of seeing myself as I truly am and, therefore, of being able to appreciate value in others, being open to new ideas, and willing to revise my own positions.The project will offer a focused programme of research.

Secondly, we aim to enhance these virtues by mindfulness training.Mindfulness is the ability to experience the present moment in its entirety and involves paying attention to internal and external phenomena as they unfold, moment by moment. Besides meditation, mindfulness also comes about from exercises such as Yoga and Tai Chi. By combining the methodologies of neuroscience, psychology and experimental economics, we aim to uncover the neurobiological roots of moral decision making manifesting in the human virtues of honesty and humility. Importantly, we conjecture that even a relatively short mindfulness course will enhance moral decision making in addition to generating changes at the neural, epigenetic and biomarker levels. We will study the relationship between these neurobiological processes, and link them to the subject's level of honesty and humility, which will be observed using behavioral economic tasks as well as questionnaires that independently measure each of these virtues.An enduring impact of this proposal is to provide proof of principle that the study of human virtue and its enhancement can be put on a firm footing in the neurosciences.

"$746,592",Big Questions,,1 September 2014 - 31 August 2017,Africa,"The aim of this project is to help Christian academics and students in French-speaking sub-Saharan Africa develop a constructive relationship between science and religion. This part of Africa is a unique melting-pot of at least three different cultural traditions: (1) a strong traditional African undercurrent with a great openness to the 'supernatural'; (2) the French Enlightenment tradition characterized by a specific understanding of 'laïcité' or secularity of the academy; (3) a history of Christian mission with strong participation by missions from conservative and sometimes fundamentalist denominations, often from North-America.This project is developed along two different but closely interrelated axes. Along one axis, it uses social science tools to explore the main discourses on the relationship between science and religion in three different university contexts in French- speaking Africa (Yaoundé, Abidjan and Kinshasa). The material collected by this field research is analyzed from a philosophical-theological angle, to understand the background and the nodes of the dominant perceptions of the relationship between science and religion in the different Christian communities. Based on this analysis, alternative approaches will be proposed to come to a more constructive relationship between the African cultural heritage, science, and Christian faith. These alternatives will also challenge dominant Western approaches to the relationship between science and religion.Along a second axis, the program intends to pilot and develop a conference and course program. These conferences will provide one of the sources for exploring how the tensions mentioned above play out on the ground. They will be a channel to test and share the insights of the research project with a crucial segment of its target audiences.This project will, on the one hand, produce results for a specialist academic audience (an academic conference, a monograph, and academic articles) and, on the other, for a wider audience of students and academics with an interest in the interface between science and religion (conferences, a website and course material). This project will present both scholars and opinion leaders in the academy and beyond it with new models for engaging in a constructive dialogue between science and religion.",0104,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/science-and-religion-french-speaking-africa

Biological information can be constructively explored only after it is made real. Thus, this project will be driven by a research paradigm called ""synthesis"". Synthesis sets a challenge that, in its pursuit, forces scientists across uncharted territory, where they must ask and answer unscripted questions. When the underlying theory fails, the synthesis fails in a way that cannot be ignored. Thus, synthesis drives discovery and paradigm change in ways that analysis cannot.We will synthesize a two-biopolymer system that can direct its own replication, catalyze metabolic steps, and adapt by evolution. However, it will manage information differently from Earth's life, which uses three informational biopolymers (DNA, RNA, protein). The two biopolymers in our ""life-like"" system will have a templator-templatee relationship, without the algorithmic instructions in known biology. The symmetry of the relationship will allow information to flow both bottom-up and top-down.This project should have enduring technological impact, as our two-biopolymer life-like system will deliver molecules with useful functions. However, it will also have enduring scientific impact. ""Central dogma"" holds that the three–biopolymer system is the only way to manage biological information. Indeed, the TWCF solicitation itself suggested that biological information was distinguishable from non-biological information because of its ""encoding"" and ""instructional"" features. A delivered working counterexample will dislodge this anthropocentricity, permitting models for biological information free from the blinders of conventionality.",0092,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/doing-bioinformation-differently-two-biopolymer-synthetic-life-form-without

If charity and generosity do not arise spontaneously, one might design transactions so that helping others remains the best rational option.In this project, we will investigate how the strategic problem above can be addressed in the global information society, with a special focus on peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols. The new concept of co-utility is central to our project. In game-theoretic terms, any interaction between peers offers co-utility or is co-utile if the best option for a player to maximize her utility is to make sure the other players also get a fair share of utility.Example utilities in the information society transactions are functionality, security, and privacy. In general, we can define these terms as follows: “Functionality” refers to a system performing its intended function/delivering its intended service in an efficient way, where “efficient” means using reasonable resources (computing time and storage, in the case of the information society). “Security” refers to a system being robust against attacks aimed at disrupting its operation or at breaking into it in order to steal, inject, or counterfeit information. “Privacy” means that the human individuals actively or passively interacting with the system can limit/control the information that is disclosed of them through that interaction.The aim of the project is to change the way information society transactions are designed: we go beyond self-enforcement by design, we aim at co-utility by-design (i.e., “If I follow the rules, this is the best option not only for me but for someone else as well”). This project will show how an information society can operate in a smooth, harmonious, and even humanitarian way under co-utile protocols and procedures. Potentially, findings may extend beyond the information society to, for example, international trade, international relations, and even international solidarity.",0095,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/co-utility-conciliating-individual-freedom-and-common-good-information-society

As in many parts of the world, television is often used to provide a distraction from many of life's problems, and help keep the family's youth from spending too much time outside the home.SAT-7 KIDS is a satellite television channel that currently has an independently measured viewing audience of at least 9 million young people, excluding the many parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents and older siblings that are watching with them. Building on the trust that SAT-7 has developed with these Arab families, the network plans to demonstrate (through some 32 focus groups involving 640 youth in 3 different Arab Countries) that the characters (attitudes, opinions, interests, values and behavior) of the next generation can be shaped by good television – to ensure that the very best values in Arab culture are preserved and that the next generation of Middle Easterners have a better chance of fully manifesting the character traits held dear by millions around the world. To this end, SAT-7 proposes a media campaign involving the production and broadcast of a series of new, original television programs or program segments which, together with carefully chosen additional acquired programs, is specifically designed to help develop character in its younger audiences; something which will help shape the next generation in the Arab World, and in turn profoundly and positively impact their societies. ",0091,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/sat-7-kids-developing-character-arab-youth-through-television-and-media-campaign

The project will seek to identify ways to support young people's curiosity in this area, and to foster their developing insight into the relationships between science and religion. The motivation for the project comes in part from our previous research which shows that in many schools, children have few opportunities to ask questions about how science and religion relate. This theme has considerable potential as a way to strengthen and increase children's access to ideas and discussion.The research will be conducted in schools in England and Australia, and will include organising days of workshops for schools in both countries. Once tested and refined, the workshop designs will be published on a free website for schools. The picture we gather through the study will help us to interact with policy makers and curriculum designers, nationally and internationally, and will also lead to high-quality publications. Alongside the research study, we will build a public awareness campaign to draw attention to the project.

This new effort is dedicated to fostering a deeper understanding of the cultural underpinnings of free enterprise and entrepreneurship in the United States and around the world—and connecting those underpinnings to the path to universal human well-being. We believe that economic well-being and happiness are impossible without a strong base of individual freedom and human rights. As Sir John Templeton once noted: “capitalism enriches the poor more than any other system humanity has had.”At AEI, we believe that the purpose of free enterprise is human flourishing, not materialism. We believe that it is only through free enterprise that we can stimulate true prosperity and innovative thinking—as opposed to simply treating poverty. To do this, we need three things: moral transformation (faith, family, community, work); material relief (housing, food, medical care), and opportunity for all (education and a strong free enterprise system). We plan to study how free enterprise can provide these things, and what the best policies are to strengthen this path to prosperity both nationally and internationally.We will also examine the basis for individual freedom in the United States and around the world; because we know that economic freedom and individual freedom must exist in tandem. As Milton Friedman noted in his renowned book, Capitalism and Freedom, “economic freedom plays a dual role in the promotion of a free society. On the one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is itself a component of freedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end in itself. In the second place, economic freedom is also an indispensable means toward the achievement of political freedom.”",0102,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/aeis-program-human-flourishing

How can agents influence the course of nature if they are, at the same time, subjected to her universal laws? How do we “fit in”? This problem of agency constitutes the overarching Big Question that this project is intended to address. An answer to this question is a necessary precondition for an understanding of free will and responsibility. While traditionally the subject of philosophy and theology, the ultimate scope and power of agents – as embodied and physical objects – has recently also become a topic of interest in quantum physics, both from a foundational perspective and through its revolutionary impact in the fields of quantum information and computation. Despite these recent advances, we are still facing age-old conceptual problems about agency and the effectiveness of our thoughts and intentions, to the point that many people are now convinced that in a fully scientific world view there is no room for a reasonable notion of agency. Our project is devoted to a critical evaluation of this trend, which we see as detrimental to the growth and development of humanity in our world.We expect to break new ground for our understanding of agency by using a multidisciplinary approach that brings together experienced researchers in quantum physics and in philosophy. We will connect these disciplines by focusing on explicit models that retain a high degree of disciplinary embedding. On the physics side, we will develop models of agency that can be fully described in the language of physics and information processing. This will include models of quantum agents that exploit basic features of quantum physics, such as quantum superposition, interference, as well as de-coherence, as a resource for their agency. On the philosophical side, research will start by analyzing these simple, but explicit physical models for agents, employing methods from analytical philosophy. We will thereby take a fresh look on different current philosophical positions regarding the problem of agency, causation, diachronic identity, intentionality, and powers.",0078,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/agency-and-quantum-physics

This is summarized in the expression: ""umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu"", that is, a person is a person through persons. The main purpose of the proposed project is to mobilize the concept of Ubuntu, so as to tackle a range of problems that confront the continent, especially in post-conflict situations. The concept of Ubuntu is researched in different contexts, each represented by a separate research cluster. The first cluster seeks to build a nuanced theoretical framework for the project, unpacking the idea of Ubuntu as a viable philosophical category. It seeks to understand Ubuntu’s etymological roots on the continent, and to surface a range of theoretical possibilities that Ubuntu is likely to offer in dealing with continental problems. The second cluster examines the concept of Ubuntu in the personal narratives of African believers in a set of selected African countries that have undergone violent and traumatic experiences. It investigates whether Ubuntu philosophy interfaces with religion in Africa, and whether Ubuntu shapes the spiritual outlook of faith communities on the continent. This cluster also explores how African communities engage with trauma, by evoking the everyday practices rooted in values of Ubuntu, to achieve recovery and healing. The third cluster approaches Ubuntu from the perspective of its negation, and focuses on inter-personal violence in Africa. There is widespread international acceptance that some form of accountability is required to prevent repetition of unlawful killings. However, how should accountability be understood in the African context? The fourth cluster will explore the relationship between (foreign) policy and the values of Ubuntu, focusing specifically on the extent to which it will be possible for South Africa to implement its declared Ubuntu foreign policy, which is aimed at the promotion of peace, security and development on the African continent.The outputs of the project are targeted at a broad audience (from academics to the youth), using different media, including research papers, talks, plays and art work. ",0085,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/meaning-and-value-ubuntu-human-and-social-development-africa

The research highlighted that students recognise that their science teachers often feel uncomfortable about addressing questions that relate to religion, whilst their RE teachers often feel they are not sufficiently knowledgeable to respond to questions about science, prompting young people to remain silent rather than feeling able to explore this subject.As such, the project runs full-day conference style school events bringing GCSE, AS and A Level students into a forum with eminent scientists who have a religious faith. The aim is to equip young people with the all-important tools they need in order to form their own opinions and engage in rational, exciting, well-reasoned and thought-provoking discussion about the place for science in God’s world. The events consist of a keynote talk by a prominent member of the science-faith community; hands-on, interactive science sessions; and, a question and answer panel session.Sir John Templeton believed that we have far more questions than answers. God and the Big Bang allows some of these fascinating questions to be aired, meeting with deeply insightful, respectful and honest answers and prompting a high level of discussion around science and faith. These events support teachers of science and religious education building their confidence in helping students to grapple with current ideas surrounding science and faith.

"$588,061",Big Questions,,24 February 2014 - 31 January 2017,North America,"Many biological systems seem driven to have high complexity, often accompanied by low entropy. Prominent examples over evolutionary timescales include the major transitions in organismal complexity, e.g., the jump from primordial soup to DNA (prokaryotes), the introduction of multipleorganelles in the same cell, and the introduction of the epigenome. If complexity is bounded below, then if a system starts with low complexity, simple stochastic drift in the value of complexity would result in its expected complexity rising in time (Gray et al. 2010, Krakauer 2011 and references therein). However most systems initialized with low complexity stay at low complexity (e.g., ideal gases). Moreover, most systems initialized with high complexity quickly simplify, as their entropy increases. The question is what distinguishes such systems, such as the many examples of biological systems that appear driven to achieve and maintain high complexity. Many processes can drive complexity increases / entropy decreases in biological systems. These include natural selection and adaptation, auto-catalysis, constructive neutral evolution, and embryogenesis. The second law of thermodynamics does not prohibit any of these processes even though they decrease entropy, since the biological systems in which they arise are open systems. However the second law may in fact underlie these processes, at a fundamental level. This possibility is known as “Schrodinger’s paradox” (Schrodinger 1944). Maynard Smith argued non-quantitatively that each major increase in organism complexity increased how much information is stored in the organism, and how much flows from higher to lower scales (Maynard Smith 1970, Maynard Smith 2000). This suggests that information theory is key to understanding these complexity increases. In addition, one can define complexity in information-theoretic terms, as the project leader has recently elaborated (Wolpert 2012). Finally, thermodynamics itself (including the second law) can be cast in terms of information theory. In light of this, we propose that information theory is the key to relating biological complexity increases and thermodynamics. ​  ",0079,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/information-theory-ecosystems-and-schrodingers-paradox
"$1,154,261",Big Questions,,3 February 2014 - 21 January 2017,Oceania,"The lack of a rigorous account of biological information as a proximal causal factor in biological systems is a striking gap in the scientific worldview. This project aims to fill that gap by grounding the idea of biological information in a contemporary philosophical account of causation, and showing that biological information is a substantive causal factor in living systems.The project is driven by biology (rather than information-theory), and we begin with the most common source of informational ideas in contemporary biology – the coding relation between nucleic acid and protein. Francis Crick's work on the problem of protein synthesis transformed the notion of biological specificity (the ability of biomolecules to catalyse very specific chemical reactions) from a physical concept based on stereochemistry (the three-dimensional shape of molecules) to an informational concept based on the linear correspondence between molecules, most famously in the case of the genetic code. ""Information"", Crick wrote, ""means here the precise determination of sequence, either of bases in the nucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein."" (1958 p153, his emphasis). We call this sense of information 'Crick information' and in the project we will use a widely supported contemporary philosophical account of causation to both give a rigorous account of 'precise determination', and to show how this idea can be grounded in particular kinds of causal relations.After operationalising Crick Information, we will extend it to show how it can be applied to the broadest possible range of biological processes. This will include information-processing in gene regulatory networks, epigenetics and the role of the environment in development, and the emergence of de novo information from processes of self-organisation. The unification of these processes under a single account of information will vindicate the idea that biological systems are distinctive amongst physical systems in being informed systems, without subscribing to a narrowly gene-centric view of biological information. ",0063,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/causal-foundations-biological-information

The philosophical component will explore the extent to which quantum information throws light on how we should understand causation and will integrate the theory and experimental results to provide a coherent defence of the thesis that information has causal power in quantum physics.

"$895,449",Big Questions,,1 November 2013 - 31 October 2016,North America,"Information and causation are two vital domains of science—and they are in need of unification. The project aims to develop a theory of information as maximally irreducible causation. Fundamental to this approach is the integrated information theory of consciousness; that is, experience as a fundamental property of reality.First, this project explores intrinsic causal information as “differences that make a difference.” It examines this notion both from the intrinsic perspective of a system in a given state (causal power, i.e., potential causes and effects), and from the perspective of an outside observer who takes into account the transitions between system states (causal action, i.e., actual causes and effects). This theory considers mechanisms in a state, the effects of causal interventions, and various facets of mechanisms. In this framework, causal information leads to a definition of emergence, meaning that the maxima of causal power can occur at a macro-level, causally superseding the micro-level.Second, this project addresses causal information during evolutionary adaptation to a complex world. The aim is to show that, under selective pressure, the causal information structure of simulated organisms will increasingly “match” the causal structure of the environment. In turn, this leads to the prediction that as organisms evolve to better understand and control their environment, their causal power will increase.One objective is to establish this evaluation of causal information as a standard tool for the analysis of complex adaptive systems.",0067,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/integrated-information-maximally-irreducible-causation

These forces fracture and fragment Bahamian society, coalescing into a self-perpetuating culture of antagonism. In response to this community fragmentation, “The Family: People Helping People” Program is an intervention designed to improve socialization in Nassau, The Bahamas. The group therapy model offers support, opportunities, and training to improve communication and relationships. The Family aims to help people replace negative emotions and behaviors with positive ones through open discussion. While similar therapy models only target one main aspect of rehabilitation, The Family project addresses a broader range of psychosocial issues to facilitate community re-building through personal transformation. The core question is: What is necessary to improve long-term socialization in the Bahamian community?De-socialization is the process of creating a presence for the Shame Self, characterized by fear, hurt, and anger, which results in a diminished and destructive view of the self, life, and the world. In contrast, re-socialization is defined as the process of developing an inner vision of the Self extending beyond one’s limitations to experience one’s potential that is characterized by love, compassion, gratitude, and forgiveness. We will address the core question of finding what is necessary to improve long-term socialization in the Bahamian community by building up the main work of The Family program through widening the therapeutic scope and teaching its doctrine to others. Resources are needed to operate The Family project over a long-term period, as well as to develop a rigorous instrument to define and evaluate how treatment is able to change the view of the Self and influence social behavior (re-socialization). Furthermore, we propose to train lay and professional therapists to aid the healing process of others in their community.

Our three chosen systems for the experiments are molecular devices, spin chains or lattices such as order-disorder ferroelectrics or simple ferromagnets, and ion traps.Each experiment will be preceded by a rigorous evaluation of the quantum coherence required for the hypothesis to be tested. In order to apply the progress on the three questions to philosophical and theological beliefs, there will be a further sub-project on experimental metaphysics, which will address the question: how can metaphysical beliefs be informed by empirical investigations? The results of the research will be presented at international conferences, and will be published through internationally peer- reviewed scholarly journals, preferably with open access. The project will concentrate on the relation between theory, experiment, and philosophy, since this is where greatest advances are currently being made. There are important questions in the relation to theology, for example in the nature and properties of information. Foundational work undertaken in this project, if it is successful, could lead to new questions and avenues of enquiry into the nature of informational and physical reality and the relation between them, including questions of how information (including spiritual information) is accessible to physical beings, and how the divine might be instantiated physically (e.g. in the Christian doctrine of incarnation).",0059,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/experimental-tests-quantum-reality
"$363,828",Big Questions,,1 October 2013 - 30 September 2016,Europe,"The purpose of this project is to discover the single underlying explanation for all distinctive properties of information in Physics and beyond, which is at once the root of both the familiar properties of information, such as transcending specific embodiments, and its apparently paradoxical quantum-mechanical ones.Our main innovative tool for addressing this is Constructor Theory, recently proposed by David Deutsch. This theory expresses all scientific theories in terms of a dichotomy between possible and impossible physical transformations - an audacious departure from existing fundamental physics (whose dichotomy is between what happens and what does not, given initial conditions).Applying the constructor-theoretic approach to information theory, we have established the result that a simple constructor-theoretic property of the laws of quantum physics implies all the disparate features that distinguish quantum information from classical, thus revealing the hitherto mysterious connection between them. (Deutsch and Marletto, 2014)Building on these results (Marletto, 2015), we have also addressed the issues of whether and how certain properties of living entities, such as the ability to self-reproduce and replicate, can be possible under no-design laws of physics. One shows that they can, provided that those laws allow, in addition to enough resources, information media, as characterised in the constructor theory of information.Our work is now focussed on two projects,“Constructor Theory of Testability” and “Constructor Theory of Probability”. The latter generalises the well-known arguments to show how the Born Rule can emerge in unitary quantum mechanics, un-augmented with additional probabilistic postulates. Our constructor-theoretic generalisation depends on fewer and much simpler axioms, which are better motivated physically and are now expressed in an information-theoretic form. The Constructor Theory of Testability uses this argument to show that Unitary Quantum Theory is testable against rival theories. A new strand of research in the direction of investigating the properties of superinformation media has also emerged, using the information-theoretic tools of constructor theory to explore the information-theoretic properties of quantum media – chiefly, the possibility of teleportation  – regarding quantum systems as a special case of superinformation media.",0068,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/constructor-theory-information
"$1,495,910",Big Questions,,1 September 2013 - 31 August 2017,Europe,"​This project addresses a serious blockage to interchange between theology or philosophy of religion and the sciences, namely the lack of adequate knowledge of actual scientific practice on the part of theologians and philosophers of religion. Following a rigorous appointment process, we have appointed three highly skilled individuals with appropriate theological and philosophical backgrounds at doctoral level. The fellows will be embedded for three years in scientific research clusters in Cambridge working at the cutting edge of their fields, and provided with substantial mentoring from both the science and the theology/philosophy sides. The fellows will also be associate members of the same Cambridge college for the duration of their fellowships, and will have regular opportunities in that context for engagement with each other, and with the wider Cambridge intellectual environment. Each fellow will be provided with the resources and the guidance necessary to pursue intensive engagement with the relevant scientists, to consult with relevant scholars nationally and internationally, to publish his or her findings, and to develop his or her career. By producing three highly-trained fellows who have had the opportunity for an extraordinarily deep engagement with working scientists, by facilitating their production of excellent publications and other scholarly contributions, and by demonstrating the fruitfulness of this kind of extended, intensive cross-disciplinary engagement, this project will be a catalyst for the next generation of work on theology / philosophy of religion and the sciences, significantly increasing the pool of people with the training necessary to produce that work. It will also develop the institutional capacity of Cambridge to host such work, by yielding deepened interdisciplinary relationships within Cambridge, between the Faculty of Divinity, the Faculty of Philosophy and the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science, and the relevant science departments and institutes.​",0062,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/templeton-twcf-post-doctoral-fellowships-theology-philosophy-religion-and

How prevalent are they, and what is their underlying psychological nature?
Can we make sense of the idea that, as Aristotle believed, most people neither have moral virtues nor moral vices, and what implications would this view have for virtue ethics, and for moral improvement in general?
What is best model of the ""role of God"" in the cultivation of character virtues?This project builds on the previous success of the Character Project with a two-year Research Program at Wake Forest University on the psychology of character, which conducts and disseminates empirical research regarding the structure, consistency, perception, and influence of traits related to moral choice. This includes research in the philosophy and theology of character, with a focus on the existence of character traits that are neither virtues nor vices, and on God's role in influencing character.Anticipated outputs include a book, a research conference, three edited volumes, nine videos, many papers and talks, and two journal special issues.

This will be via both targeted projects, tackling major but tractable questions, and public outreach. Concerning the former, we will ask (a) Is evolution constrained in its outcomes? and (b) What (if any) limits are there to biological complexity? How constrained evolutionary outcomes might actually be will be addressed by the search for fundamental similarities in the distribution of homoplasies (effectively convergences) in widely disparate phylogenies, combined with the construction of hypothetical phylogenies that will assess the functional credibility of counterfactual forms. The investigation of biological complexity intends to determine whether upper limits can be identified to complex biological systems, and to what extent a given system can be described as optimal. Both are huge areas, but we are confident that by keeping the fundamental questions in focus then we can identify principles that are central to our understanding of evolution. Public outreach will focus on a bespoke website and an ambitious range of associated activities, designed to give crisp summaries of what we do know and as importantly address the unsolved problems. Specific outputs will include a book, about eight peer-reviewed papers and a major e-space footprint to provide a fresh face to evolutionary debates. The project aims to reshape both the scientific and public perception of evolution. In doing so it will redefine the “evolution wars”, emphasizing questions that too often are “off-limits” and so helping to re-engage a sceptical public. Thus in terms of enduring impact we aim at a sea-change in the way evolution is viewed, both by the professional community and by the public at large: the former will be invited to re-visit some cherished assumptions, the latter encouraged in serious engagement.     ​",0037,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/new-agenda-evolution
"$903,807",Character Virtue Development,,15 March 2013 - 14 March 2016,North America,"Fifty years ago, William Bowers (1964) launched his seminal work on cheating behaviors among college students across the nation. He undertook a large-scale, multi-campus study of about 5,000 students in 99 colleges and universities. According to his findings, educational leaders greatly underestimated the magnitude of academic honesty violations among college students. He found that three-fourths of students admitted to at least one form of cheating and over half of students admitted to two forms (Bowers, 1964, p. 48).  Today, the percentage of students who report being engaged in academic dishonesty violations remains high. In a recent book reviewing the state of the literature on academic dishonesty, McCabe, Butterfield, and Treviño (2012) consistently found that more than two-thirds of college students report being involved in incidents of academic dishonesty (p. 71).To better understand and address this problem, various scholars have undertaken a variety of studies of individual factors (e.g. age, gender, social class, ethically desirable traits, religiosity) and curricular as well as co-curricular contextual factors (e.g. honor code, peers’ behaviors, understanding and acceptance of integrity policy, faculty behavior and actions, etc.) that are linked with student dishonesty (for a thorough summary see McCabe et al., 2012). Despite this research, McCabe et al. (2012) noted in their review of individual factors, “Although we know quite a bit, we often don’t have enough high-quality research to make strong claims about such relationships. Clearly, more studies are needed” (p. 89). In light of this need, we are undertaking a national study of traditionally aged college students in partnership with Gallup®. For the quantitative portion of the study, we collected data from a national representative sample of 2,503 students. From the sample, Gallup® recruited 75 participants for the qualitative portion of the study.  In general, we are seeking to gain a greater understanding of individual and social factors that influence cheating.  In addition, we are exploring a promising new line of research that investigates the relationship between academic honesty and virtues such as self-control and life purpose.",0060,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/character-virtues-and-college-students-pilot-study

This innovative project aims to nurture, inspire, and support the development of mathematical genius by encouraging and fostering creativity.Creativity is often overlooked when teaching mathematics. What characterizes the most outstanding mathematicians, however, is their creative flair. They ask new questions, pose new problems, apply familiar techniques in creative ways and make connections between apparently disparate ideas.The project will create a distinct, new program of innovative educational resources, including a substantial collection of resources aimed at students of all ages from 7 to 16. The principal resources we are creating are rich and engaging open tasks, published online on a dedicated project portal, the new Wild Maths website. These rich tasks are presented in thematically-linked pathways supporting progression towards increasingly sophisticated thinking, independence, and creativity. The online resources are designed to encourage students to explore and make connections. They include inspirational, explanatory articles and videos, as well as opportunities for students to share and discuss ideas. Hands-on workshops provide further opportunities to develop and explore mathematical creativity, and a public lecture program provides stimulus and inspiration.In addition, we hope to contribute to a shift in classroom culture towards more creative and collaborative learning by working with teachers and providing rich resources for educators. Further project resources are therefore published on our established NRICH website, adapted for classroom use, and accompanied by teacher guidance.Mathematical creativity is an exciting, emerging field of study and research. This project is one of the first attempts to create a substantial, coherent body of resources specifically focused on fostering genius through developing creativity, and should therefore have a significant enduring impact",0069,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/developing-mathematical-creativity
"$2,148,236",Big Questions,,1 January 2013 - 31 December 2015,Europe,"Scientism is the view that science, and science alone, can give us knowledge, tell us what exists, and answer our moral, existential, and religious questions. The central question in the proposed research project is:   What are the problems of scientism and how can it be overcome? We propose that scientism is not only false, but also harmful. False, because there are other sources of knowledge besides science. Harmful, because it undermines notions that are central to human self-understanding and flourishing, and to various social and professional practices; notions such as free will, rational decision-making, moral character, and religious belief.To find out what the problems of scientism are, and how they can be overcome, we ask three subsidiary questions to be addressed in three parts of the research project: 1. How does scientism manifest itself in research about free will, rational decision making, moral character, and religious belief and how does it affect social and professional practices informed by these areas of research? 2. How can scientism be analysed in a philosophically rigorous manner, what are the arguments for and against it, and how good are these arguments? 3. What does a non-scientistic framework for integrating scientific knowledge with other sources of knowledge look like?In order to conduct the project, we aim to establish The Abraham Kuyper Centre for Science and Religion at VU University Amsterdam, which can accommodate national and international scholars, organise conferences and workshops, maintain a website, and communicate with the press. This Centre will be of great interest in itself during the project as well as assure the impact of the project beyond the funding period. Through this project, we hope to bring about a dismantling of scientism and explicate what science without a commitment to scientism looks like. The enduring impact of the project is that it will free minds, inside and outside academia, to acknowledge various limits of science, as well as to acknowledge extra-scientific sources of knowledge.  ",0038,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/science-beyond-scientism-abraham-kuyper-centre-science-and-religion
"$383,530",Big Questions,,1 January 2013 - 30 June 2015,Europe,"The primary purpose of the grant is to investigate whether and how neuroscience can contribute to increasing joy in people's lives. Given the importance of joy and the presumed control of emotions by the brain, surprisingly little is known about the neurobiological underpinning of increasing joy. Here we approach this question in a series of experiments, using behavioral and neuroimaging methods. The aim is to elucidate causal neurobiological mechanisms related to increasing joy.Correlational studies provide the building blocks for an experiment in which we aim to make people more joyful with a neuroimaging-based training approach. One experiment investigates the role of extrinsic rewards in eliciting joy as opposed to intrinsic up-regulation by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Another experiment investigates the neural effects of a psychological intervention to increase joy. If these experiments are successful, the regions showing commonly enhanced activation in both experiments will serve as regions of interest for the neuroimaging feedback training.These experiments will provide novel insights into the neural implementation of joy and will illuminate the promises but also the limitations and pitfalls of the neurobiological approach to joy. Results may have the potential of revealing a behavioral and non-pharmacological path to increasing joy. More generally, we envisage that the present research will have an impact on the understanding of positive emotions, their differentiability into joy and happiness and their neural underpinning.",0036,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/pathways-joy-neurobiological-account

"$2,424,132",Big Questions,,1 January 2012 - 31 December 2015,North America,"What is the relationship between scientists and religion across the globe?It is often claimed that science is incompatible with religion and culpable for secularization. Tension is felt on a global scale as scholars argue that religion hinders the progress and acceptance of science in the United States, Europe, and parts of Asia. Yet no research to date has addressed how scientists view religion and how religion influences scientists in different regional contexts.The Religion among Scientists in International Context study is the first-ever empirical study of religion and spirituality among scientists in a cross-regional context. It includes a cross-regional survey of over 22,525 biologists and physicists at different points in their careers. They hail from top universities and research institutes in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, and Turkey—regions that have very different levels of religiosity, levels of scientific infrastructure, and approaches to the relationship between religious and state institutions. The project also includes follow-up qualitative interviews with 609 of these scientists.Through these two instruments, we can determine how scientists in different regional contexts understand the relationship between science and religion (and, where relevant, spirituality). We can also determine how religion and spirituality influence their research agendas, daily interactions with students, and ethical decisions and discussions. The dataset, articles, and books we produce will reshape the secularization debate, create new measures of religion and spirituality, and initiate a new research agenda within the social sciences. Furthermore, our findings will help improve public policy efforts to increase productive dialogue between scientists and religious communities in different regional contexts by uncovering similarities and differences in how they perceive the proper relationship between science, religion, and spirituality.",0033,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/religion-among-scientists-international-context

The aim of this grants program is to fund research projects, for periods up to a maximum of eighteen months, that investigate and expose the ways in which biological ideas are utilized for non-biological purposes.Every generation has its own particular uses and abuses of biology which also vary according to culture, religion and geographical location. Of greatest interest are cases in which society, or a certain segment of society, prospers or flounders under the influence of the appropriation of biological ideas. Abuses of biology can lead to situations in which the value of either science or spiritual values, or sometimes both, are subverted. This can lead to divided societies in which individuals and organizations are constrained by limited vision and inability to cooperate. Abuses can also lead to people becoming highly resistant to scientific ideas and to new spiritual information, and can contribute to close-minded attitudes about the nature of divinity.This Programme will lay bare a significant number of specific cases in which biological thought has been and is being applied to promote socio-political agendas and reshape core values, thus allowing those agendas and values to be re-evaluated by those who hold them and are affected by them.",0025,https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/uses-and-abuses-biology-sub-grants-programme

The fact that the world’s largest nation—China—is officially secular, allegedly has a long history of dominant non-religious philosophies, and reportedly has a large proportion of atheists challenges the naturalness of religion thesis, doesn’t it? From “the Chinese Challenge” project, which has now concluded, we have gathered more evidence that the cognitive mechanisms that allegedly encourage religious thought and action are present in contemporary (and were present in past) Chinese populations. It may be that, contrary to some scholarly suggestions, vitalistic reasoning (which allegedly underlies traditional Chinese medicine and other Chinese traditions concerning qi), may not be among those mechanisms. This evidence supports the claim that underlying religious expression throughout the world is a suite of cognitive mechanisms largely the product of normal human development in essentially any human environment.
